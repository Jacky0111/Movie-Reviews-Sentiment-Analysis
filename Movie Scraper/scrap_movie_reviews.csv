0,"That's one of the best marvel movie! I love the storytelling and the action, that was amazing. But honestly i didn't expect that. Friends told me that this is a great movie, but i watched trailer and it didn't impress me at all. One thing is a little disappointing it's the lack of fighting of the shan chi himself.",NEGATIVE
1,"Stupid, lazy and boring, I guessed the ending in the first 5 minutes, and it just goes on with what you expect what would happen, i didn't fill any tension throw the whole movie, and i found my self looking at my phone, The only good thing i can say about this is that the acting is ok.",NEGATIVE
2,Disturbingly Cringe. It's all bad jokes and cringe. An hour and a half of my life wasted,NEGATIVE
3,"F9 was fun, and after last year that is all I wanted. We can over analyze this film til the cows come home, we really can. Cena at times comes off flat. The story could have been a little more coherent. It had some big plot holes, the jokes didn't always land, but it gave me hot cars, beautiful locations, non stop fast paced action, actual human beings as characters. So it wasn't perfect or based in reality. If you want perfect the criterion collection has a channel. If you want something based in reality just go to your friends house during Tax Season, or sit in during a heated couple's argument. If you want a popcorn movie that doesn't involve an evil Purple Space Man that wears a doomsday device glove powered by colored stones, or Space Wizards frantically trying to do anything to spark nostalgia in hopes of rebooting a franchise that ended in 1983, so they can build an addition to a theme park for their parent company, then this movie is for you. This movie was fun, it didn't need to be anything else, and after last year don't you want fun?",NEGATIVE
4,"For 29 years Candyman fans have been waiting for the 1992 classic to get the sequel it deserves. It looked that was finally about to happen after all these years thanks to Nia DaCosta and, to a lesser extent, Jordan Peele. The social commentary that was largely absent in Farewell to the Flesh and Day of the Dead would be returning to add some much needed depth back into the mix without the white influence that, while well-meaning back then, would not have been met so warmly today, and maybe with the same kind of creative chills that made Get Out and Us so exciting. Unfortunately the wait goes on as despite the appearance of some incredible ideas this 2021 continuation fall short of its own lofty ambitions by backing itself into a self-defeating corner. The issue is that it's actively trying to be a sequel. It's clear that DaCosta and crew want to transform the titular character from the ghost of one African-American's suffering into an instrument of black vengeance. He's no longer just Daniel Robitaille. He's Eric Garner. He's Tamir Rice. He's George Floyd. At least until he's not anymore and becomes Daniel Robitaille again in an ending that contradicts everything the film had spent so long trying to set up and completely wastes Tony Todd anyways. This problem arises because in an effort to correct the perspective of its predecessor that came from it being a product of its time, they incorrectly wrote themselves into a position where he basically HAD to come back. A large portion of the running-time is dedicated to establishing connections and ties to the original, so we're constantly reminded of who the Candyman was there and eagerly await his return. Something that makes the appearance of this ""Sherman"" dude in his place rather irritating. It makes sense from a thematic standpoint, but man is it unfilling. Worse is that they could have gotten away with it had they not kept referencing what Bernard Rose had created prior. They made it so the past hangs over everything like an oppressive cloud that kills any enthusiasm for what's actually here when they should have gone the full reboot route and given their own ideas room to breathe. Speaking of room to breathe, this is one of those rare cases where a longer runtime would have been a good thing. A core component of the plot is the main character's gradual physical and mental descent into becoming someone (or something) in a way he doesn't seem fully aware of. Only it's not so gradual at all. He just seems to go insane from the moment he says the summoning words into a reflective surface, which feels unnatural and rushed. It's a cool body horror element that also never really comes into fruition. In fact, the horror side as a whole fails to deliver. DaCosta relies on cheap gore rather than truly effective frights to get the job done, kind of missing the point when it comes to what made the first Candyman scary. Most of the time though it's too caught up in its own dull plotting, unresolved threads, and hollow characters making the whole thing a bit of a bore. All of which might have been acceptable had there have been a satisfying payoff, but for the aforementioned reasons it shoots itself in the foot preventing that from being a possibility. While this may be a movie with a lot of ideas that don't come together, it only crumbles under the weight of one. It should have unshackled itself from the past entirely. Never mentioned Helen Lyle or brought back Todd for the few brief seconds he's in here. As by placing itself in the shadow of that earlier work, it has put certain expectations on itself that it feels the need to fulfill just as much as the audience needs to see them be fulfilled. This is not only a shame, but frustrating as well as it keeps the film's own bold and compelling reinvention of the property from ever taking hold when you can totally see how it could have succeeded if they hadn't of attempted the fruitless balancing act of fidelity and emendation. If there's one thing its flawed conclusion is good for though it's that it leaves the door still open for the possibility of this franchise not just being a one hit wonder at some point in the future, how ever delusional that hope may be. As of right now though, many will be left wanting for a while longer yet. This 2021 version, promising though it was and brilliant in brief instances, is (accidentally) counterproductive in the worst way. 4.9/10",NEGATIVE
5,"Fun, vibrant and endlessly entertaining. There wasn't a moment of this film that I didn't enjoy.",POSITIVE
6,"Did you wonder what bumbling Joe Biden did in his basement during the election? He wrote this movie. Did you want to watch a movie that tells you you're a racist if you love your country and refuse to allow millions of immigrants across the border unchecked? This is the one for you. On top of that it has all the woke check marks. Girls doing it for themselves, Anti-Americanism. Socialism. And real life Nazis with swastika face tattoos!! Do not watch this movie if you have an IQ over 20. All of this is on CNN.",NEGATIVE
7,Surprised this one is getting such a positive response. Poor by MCU standards. Story sucked. Didn’t care about the family. Acting performances were bad to mediocre with the sister being the worst in any MCU film. Took a ton of swings on laughs and came out average there. Completely forgettable bother than the bus scene.,NEGATIVE
8,It’s good but not great. Very interesting the way it ties into the first one. A lot of great acting. A few good jumps scares. All the reviews complaining about “woke messages” and “propaganda” are nonsense. Disregard. Go see the movie for yourself and keep an open mind.,POSITIVE
9,"Things That I Liked Most In The Jungle Cruise Movie!! 1) Perfect Casting Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt were electric together. They both bring so much fun to the movie. I love their chemistry. Besides the main hero and heroine, the character of Jack Whitehall was excellent. He played the role of Emily's brother & he rocked it with his performance. He brought so many comedic moments. 2) Great Comedy And Action The action & comedy were moving along at about the right pace, never dwelling too long on any of the plot points. 3) World-Building The sets, costumes, animals, vibrant colors, darker elements of Amazon, the intro of main characters, every single thing was beautiful enough to maintain the classic atmosphere.",POSITIVE
10,This was pure schlock. Lost interest halfway through the first fight scene.,NEGATIVE
11,"Incredible. I am in tears, visually beautiful, heavy and relevant subject matter, beautifully composed music, intense inter-actor connection. cotillard and driver were the perfect artists to pull this off. I loved the conductor. It comes off niche, but it can be enjoyed by anyone with a brain. the people who rate this low are uncultured swine and I am proud to not share a perspective with them. BRAVO!",POSITIVE
12,"Типичный фильм с Районом Рейнольдсом где должно быть смешно, а на самом деле нет. А еще сюжет это смесь WALL E и Первому игроку приготовиться.",NEGATIVE
13,Loved the film! Raw: pain and love... a simply beautiful depiction of the life behind the camera....the true life behind the camera. But In the end it is between us and God.,POSITIVE
14,"Woman, for absolutely no reason, signs up to go into a computer simulation where she can talk to her estranged mother who has become comatose while in prison for burning down a care home but there's demons.",NEGATIVE
15,Great one by marvel,POSITIVE
16,"I wanted to watch a mindless popcorn action movie and I got a movie that feels written, directed, and edited by Wile Coyote. So entertaining but nonsensical. Hyper-cut, consequence-free, and physics-less action, disorientating plot, and monotoned characters with plot armor. It's bad but fun watch on a boarding night when you can't spare any brainpower.",NEGATIVE
17,I love it. A very good movie with handsome Ryan Reynolds AKA Deadpool. Everywhere is some good easter egg here and I really enjoy it.,POSITIVE
18,"Wow, that was not good. What a waste of the Emily Blunt, and to a lesser extend, The Rock. Disney, stop using these no name directors. Label me bad, but French people do not get humour. Any American director would've done a better job. The jokes' timing were poor, the editing during conversations were unimaginative, the action boring, and don't get me started on the CG. Compare this to the 1st Pirates movie, it's a million miles away.",NEGATIVE
19,"Solid movie, kept me entertained the whole time. Wasn't too long and the concept was really cool",POSITIVE
20,"Shang Chi is just another addition to the impressive lore MCU has brought forth with their connected universe. The movie works mainly due to the story it brings out with respect to the folks linked to a distinctive fantasy world and powers appropriated by their descent, the perfect balance of humor, action and the on-screen chemistry between the lead characters. The phase 4 MCU seems to be hitting on all the cylinders so far. The post credit sequences might generate more interest among fans looking forward to the next.",POSITIVE
21,"Bring tissues! I cried three times during this movie. Jennifer Hudson absolutely KILLS it in this! In the theater I was in, everyone clapped at the end. Amazing movie!",POSITIVE
22,"While this French crime drama-comedy serves up a modest share of chuckles and action sequences, its lack of defined motivations and its overpacked story threads tend to water down what could have been a better film had it incorporated an overall sense of greater clarity. When an underpaid French-Arabic police translator working for the narco squad intercepts an undercover message involving the son of a friend, she tries to intervene to shield him while simultaneously cashing in for herself on privileged (and highly lucrative) information, launching a deluge of hot pursuit against her on multiple fronts. Director Jean-Paul Salome's uneven offering benefits tremendously from the superb performance by the ever-reliable Isabelle Huppert, despite the fact that this vehicle is somewhat beneath her considerable talents. And, when the laughs work, they're genuinely funny, even if they come somewhat few and far between. But, despite these strengths, some judicious overall tidying up is required to make this one work more effectively.",POSITIVE
23,This could have been a good movie and I enjoyed parts of it. What I didn't care for was the woke ideals being spouted every 15 minutes. Hollywood is just unable to make a neutral tone film and it is wrecking the industry.,NEGATIVE
24,"Nicolas Cage departs from his usual fare as a gruff action hero for this opportunity to be more sensitive. He plays a recluse who makes his living from the truffles that his pet pig uncovers. When she’s “pignapped,” he sets out to Portland where his past life slowly reveals itself. First-time feature director Michael Sarnoski has given the film a quietly paced, somewhat poetic European feel. It’s a character study that unfolds with mildly interesting and unexpected developments, but also gives Cage an opportunity to play it down (but still doesn't dilute his signature intensity). A dark, somber but ultimately positive character study.",POSITIVE
25,Giving this movie a 10 because it’s one of the funniest movies I’ve ever seen. If you’re on the fence about watching this movie absolutely go see it.,POSITIVE
26,"Reminiscence has certainly a lot of ideas but lack focus. The story just setup too much stuff and maybe worst of all, try to tie them all together through a memory machine. Those ideas aren't bad at all, it's just that you can do a movie for each of them instead of cooking all those ingredients together. The actors are pretty good in the movie. The FX are impressive. The action is minimal. The best action is surely the hand fight in the end. The singing is great but the soundtrack isn't always with the scenes. I found the rhythm to be a bit slow. I give it 53%. I think Lisa Joy can definitively do better, but you see that she didn't exactly do a nice transition between Tv to movie.",NEGATIVE
27,"I love Winstead, but was awful to watch her jump the bandwagon of the latest crappy feminist action movie that has been dumped to streaming platforms this year. A mixture of Crank and John Wick in a very unrealistic outcome. Winstead´s presentation as an assassin is awful. Who texts confirmation messages to her next hit the day before the hit? Her tactics is also very amateur, Taking a sniper shot from kneling position is way worse than a prone position when she has the opportunity to do so. The car chase scene in this movie is also dreadfully bad, totally sped up and fake AF. It is entirely CGI and a very bad rendered one at that. Woody Harrelson has a central, but not so present role. But he can not rescue this movie one bit. Overall, this movie left me with a bad taste metal in my mouth..",NEGATIVE
28,I didn't really like the plot. It felt like it was trying to do way too many things at once. Overall the acting was good but the plot needed a rewrite or more editing.,NEGATIVE
29,Exciting because of the mystery and the original story. This film quickly manages to grab you through the unknown. Despite the cast that feels akward at times (especially Vicky Krieps as the mother) it is a film that knows how to hold your attention to the end. Maybe it was my cup of tea because of the setting reminds me of the series lost but it is a recommendation for the people who love thrillers in general.,POSITIVE
30,"Fast 9 is a great representation of what the fast saga truly is. I was so siked to see the trailer come out a year ago, and it’s awesome that it’s finally out. Furious 9 was a great reunion to the Tokyo drift cast, as well as having Mia back. Seeing Han return while casually snacking on some chips made me smile and think of the good old days. I think the only thing that would have made me 100% satisfied with the reunion would be having gal gadot come back to life RIP :( overall this movie was so fun and had me laughing with ludacris and tyrese’s comedic comments that played throughout the movie. Having roman begin to question how they are still alive cracks me up. I loved watching this in theaters because the reactions from the crowd during the movie showed how much this franchise means to the world. Cant wait for fast 10!!",POSITIVE
31,"It lacks the psychological and ideological complexity to express the complete alienation of its main character. Especially since the film never seems to be sure what it wants to do with him. Is he a psychopath or a sociopath? Quite ambiguous and totally anticlimactic. Obviously there's something extremely disturbing about the main character, but the lethargy of its development, and the poverty of resolutions only give the idea that perhaps there's a monster behind the facade, but only that.",NEGATIVE
32,"The movie is a one time thing. I don’t wanna watch it again and honestly if I could I would go back and unwatch it. But since I can’t and I now have to live with this, I will say the kids loved it, so that’s good I guess. I’d say just stick with the show though. It’s so much better, the voice actors are way better in the show than in the movie. I have it a seven bc it’s a kids movie and the kids liked it so that’s all that matters.",POSITIVE
33,This movie is simply amazing! It shows how funny ryan is and the movie is hilarious and action packed. Definitely one of my favorite movies of the year!,POSITIVE
34,"Fun, bonkers horror flick courtesy of James Wan. This film will split audiences and critics with its audacity. Either you will say WT% or be hollering and cheering at its twist and turns. I found this to be an original film that cements Wan as a true master of horror, The John Carpenter for our generation. All the tricks and trades that he learned, be it in the horror and the action genre are well used here. To say more would be a travesty, but this in my opinion is one of the best horror film of 2021.",NEGATIVE
35,"Pig is one of the best films I have seen in years. It is a brilliant and captivating movie about depression, loss, and the inability to move on after tragedy. Also, Nicolas Cage and Alex Wolff give emotional and realistic performances that are definitely worth seeing. In my eyes, this is a best picture contender.",POSITIVE
36,"Puts you into Lucy's shoes, and really isolates you. Ending catches you off guard",POSITIVE
37,"Best way to describe it, opening scene felt like they were taking it serious and then realized ""wait, we are the F&F!"" and just went on a speed run of events and action sequences that made no sense. If you are watching it just for the meme of it and for purely an ""action"" movie, you will probably enjoy it. If you are watching it for the pure hope it helps or revives the dying franchise from what it once was, don't. I facepalmed and sighed more times than I can remember. Ramon's lines are pretty funny, as well as Tej. Jakob is actually pretty good and the flashback scenes are pretty good. But that's all I can say other than the word ""family"" is only said three times. 3 Families out of 10.",POSITIVE
38,"(Mauro Lanari) The references are many, obvious and blatant, and Dwayne Johnson has learned to self-produce to impress his unmistakable trademark, in this case even a metacinematographic signature: it's all a simulation, a staging as much as the farce of wrestling, omnipresent smile, zero suspense. It had already happened with the Jumanji franchise, he is reiterating it with each of his new (?) films.",NEGATIVE
39,It tries to be sentimental and fails completely. And why do memories produce a complete 3D scene from a third person perspective? Answer: plot convenience. I didn't buy any of it.,NEGATIVE
40,"Working in games, I was a bit apprehensive. Of course, some plot elements would not work in real life, but hey, it's a big, loud, colourful popcorn movie. 7 out of 10 for an interesting premise. I am always wondering what the NPCs may think in a game. 6 out of 10 for the execution; the film, while entertaining, feels a bit clunky at certain times. 8 out of 10 for being pretty much spot on about working conditions and dev politics in the big game industry. Interesting bit: girlfriend, who is a non-gamer, liked it more than I did.",POSITIVE
41,"Esta película fue una grata sorpresa, no esperaba nada ella y termino siendo una de mis películas favoritas de superhéroes.",NEGATIVE
42,This is the craziest of them all! They actually went to space and drive magnet cars!!! What a film!,POSITIVE
43,"Outstanding movie that explains the origins of PTSD, the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, the origins of the debacle in Afghanistan, etc. Well timed for the US exit from Afghanistan.",POSITIVE
44,This movie was realy great I enjoy it alot won't mind watch it again and and most all was great movie. And full of adventure,NEGATIVE
45,"Personally, I love the movie base on some certain scene and the way they act. So entertaining and loving to watch",POSITIVE
46,"The acting and pace of this movie pull away from what may have been a decent movie. Even the twist can't redeem this film. Do yourself a favor and skip this one, even once it is streaming.",NEGATIVE
47,This is James best work. Like the Matrix of horror movies as far as being something that pushes the genre forward ! Great movie and a must watch. Has one of the best action sequences I ever seen a horror movie ever !!!!! A ware horror movie that focuses on being an actually good movie instead of just jump scares !!!!!,POSITIVE
48,"It's OK. It is an hour and 15 minute episode of the regular show with crazy detailed animation and blink and you miss them ""celebrity"" voices. There are no fart jokes so it has that going for it. Chase is dealing with PTSD for some reason and gets over it for some other reason. There is a new dog that serves no purpose. No singing. It is over quickly and it is not too annoying for an adult.",POSITIVE
49,"Good-1) Michael Keaton-good accent, good character work all around. Love the scene where the camera focuses on his face for about 2 minutes, and he pretty subtly gives you the measure of all his thoughts from a series of uncomfortable micro expressions. 2) Script-it must have been really hard to construct a compelling narrative from what seems like just a bunch of bureaucratic decision making. I’m guessing they made a lot of stuff up in terms of interactions between the lawyers and the survivors, but they did a good job of it. Some cliche driven scenes, but could be worse. 3) Michael Keaton and Stanley Tucci- these guys are so good together and at their respective character types that, just as in “Spotlight”, they should become the Crosby and Hope of procedural investigation films. 4) The scene where they show 9/11 happening from the perspective of Feinberg’s (Keaton) morning commute. Bad-1) So I’m sure the team working on the compensation fund was probably huge, with too many characters to develop if you want a cohesive story. And maybe the group was also originally super white,super male and super old. I don’t know. But when adapting true life material, if you’re going to add second tier characters that have to carry the burden of all your inclusion, please give them something to **** do and say. And if the original team was not super male white and old there’s even less excuse. 2) Feinberg’s wife was so great in her first scene, and then by mid way through the movie she doesn’t even get to sit next to him at the opera. 3) More Stanley Tucci please. Always more Stanley Tucci.",POSITIVE
50,Another homerun for Marvel. Glad that this was the first film I decided to watch in theaters since the Pandemic hit. Such a beautiful film to see on the big screen.,POSITIVE
51,"You got some good actors in this movie, but it doesn't help. The problem with this movie is the writing. The way the talk to each others,it just off. A sign that a movie probably is going to be bad is if the same person write and direct a movie.",NEGATIVE
52,"Godd acting, good ambience, tangential horror. Too many ""say my name"", ""white people this"", ""white people that"". Could have been great, but it is nothing but a pamphlet movie screaming mottos and ideologies. Unfortunately wasted opportunity...",NEGATIVE
53,esta buena la pelicula y la disfrute mucho espero que le llega muy bien en taquilla,NEGATIVE
54,"(Mauro Lanari) Once again in the psychothanatological area, coping with the death of loved ones or the mourning of any existence is a topic that in the 21st century should be treated starting from the 1st season of ""True Detective"", while the debutant Sarnoski takes the shortcut of instilling silence with the silence, loneliness with the loneliness, emptiness with the emptiness, sadness with the sadness and so on. It's called the rhetorical method, and I am not aware that aesthetics has ever changed its mind on this point.",NEGATIVE
55,I agree towards the end the movie does seem to lose focus and leave the audience a little unsatisfied. But everything building up to the final act is great. Some memorable scenes and great use of grief and loss. Its for sure worth buying a ticket for.,POSITIVE
56,"Don't waste your time. 0/10 of actor play, 0/10 of storytelling. Worthless movie.",NEGATIVE
57,"It was a good movie to watch. This movie had some good points and some bad points. Good Points: Matt Demon was excellent and thoroughly convincing as Bill. His character development and performance were brilliant. There were some good emotional moments and the love plot was too good. Bad Points: This movie was 2 hours long and most of the time was spent on the love story and character development. They almost forgot the crime and thrilling part of the movie. Also, the ending was rushed and unsatisfying. It was boring as the first act was too long and they drag the movie without any reason.",NEGATIVE
58,"Insanity, ridiculousness, and a lot fun. A must watch if you're bored of the same stale horror modern tropes. A genuinely fun time. Lots of gore and lots of surprises. This movie is bonkers in the best way possible.",POSITIVE
59,"Original and very well crafted horror ride. Reminded me of original ""Evil Dead"".",NEGATIVE
60,"Waste of an hour and a half. If you are going to watch a scary movie with a dumb story the entertainment comes from the scares. This movie is not scary, the jump scares boil down to the movie getting quiet for a second and then a loud unnatural sound effect. For an example, in the beginning they transition a scene with a loud unnatural snapping noise because the main character steps on a stick in the next scene. In scenes where there could be scares and the candyman is killing people they decide not to show it. This movie felt more like an excuse to tell people “gentrification is bad, white people are racist, cops are bad.” I would give it a zero but I did like some of the cinematography in a couple scenes.",NEGATIVE
61,"Jungle Cruise is the latest movie to come out of Hollywood which falls into what I call the CG Social Justice Diarrhea-fest. These types of movies are heavy on fake-looking CG, and indignantly hit you over the head with social justice issues, and Jungle Cruise falls squarely into that category. From the beginning Emily Blunt is constantly told that she can't do things because she's a woman, but spoiler alert, she's better at everything then all the men! What a shocking twist! We've never seen that trope before have we? She's even better at fixing the engine of the steamboat than The Rock is, even though he's been using and repairing it for decades. Later on we find that her annoying brother is tagging along on the dangerous journey because he is a homosexual and society back then treated them poorly instead of throwing pride parades for them every day. Boo hoo! Keep your kids away from this one folks. Disney, how far you've fallen!",NEGATIVE
62,"The movie was OK and the acting was OK. All I know is that there were only a few of us in the theater and no one stayed until the end. I was the last one to leave a completely empty theater near the end. I felt that I knew where the movie was going and there was no reason to stick around any longer. At that point, it felt a little long. Okay movie. I guess.",NEGATIVE
63,"The film is overall average in terms of the storyline and characters. It is weighed down with some noticeable problems, mainly when it comes to cinematography and tone. But The Forever Purge is entertaining enough, and sets up its interesting premise well enough, for these problems not to bog down the film to much. It should be stated though, this film is very, very political. If you lean more to the right, you may not like The Forever Purge as much. I'd give it a watch if you have some cash to burn and want to be entertained for 90 minutes. General audiences will most likely enjoy it.",POSITIVE
64,Sure would like to know how this movie is getting high ratings. Lack luster story line with little flow. I highly recommend spending your time doing something else. If you follow me you know I reluctantly grade in the red but this film deserves it.,POSITIVE
65,"Great action movie with real martial artist-actors. Real action that actually feels like it's happening I was surprised right away that the punches didn't feel like faked punches. The stories' minor twists were actually surprising to me. I don't generally enjoy being confused to satiate some elitist critic, simple good action movie please and thank you.",POSITIVE
66,"Technically this is great, however it completely fails as a horror and is a schizophrenic comedy without any apparent structure. It is not scary in the least, and it makes no sense. It was like a child with ADHD was asked to tell a story while they were high on Halloween candy. The downside is that the 'story' is incoherent, trying to be everything at all times with reason. This leads to dialogue and motivation that the director could not handle, and the acting appear to be poor, yet if you have seen enough bad movies, you know these actors and actresses are doing the best with the material they have. Some are comparing Malignant to Evil Dead series, but that is a superficial comparison as that classic series had an infinite amount of structure compared to this. The real shock is that this does have a lot of fun moments, and may be worth a watch if you are into these movies. This does not change the fact that it is not a good movie. A lot of reviewers fall into the trap of thinking that if they like it, it must be at least a 7. This is quite possibly one of those movies, where it is objectively not very good based on what it wanted to accomplish, but is entertaining in unintentional ways that elevate it. Just be prepared to have a bit of a headache, and the need to mutter WTF over and over, after the movie ends. The twist is highly predicable, but due to the pathological need to do nothing in the standard method, you will never guess how it is carried out. If there was any logic to this, then the cast could actually follow and give a more grounded performance (again this in on the director, not them). So hopefully when this gets a sequel, it will try to be a bit more coherent while acknowledging it was an accidental comedy, and leaning into that. 5/10 - Objectively 7/10 - Subjectively (which may change once my brain heals and I give it a second watch)",POSITIVE
67,"Good movie. I don't understand why so many people treat him so badly? I liked this film, although not 100%))",POSITIVE
68,"A Great Fun, Suspenseful Thriller, and Action Movie and as good as the first one in it's own way, must watch.",POSITIVE
69,"Reach your goal but do not sacrifice your dear ones, and you will get rewarded.",POSITIVE
70,"Nothing to see here except the lovely Milana Vayntrub. There's a single scene in the movie where she dances to 'I Saw the Sign' by Ace of Base which I personally really enjoyed. After that I could have just turned the movie off because it was terrible. It wasn't funny, scary or entertaining. It was just a load of poorly written characters running around doing dumb stuff for no reason until the credits roll. And there's very little werewolf in the whole movie.",NEGATIVE
71,"I saw this movie yesterday and I`m really torn, the main story is pretty good and the martial arts fight scenes are really well done. But one (Awkwafina) character is the constant comic relief in the movie, every 2 minutes she is cracking jokes, after a while it is very distracting and from halfway through the movie she doesn`t make sense to be around, she feels like the producer signed her after the script was ready and she had to be shoehorned in. The sister should have had more screen time she is far more interesting than Katy. And the very last battle is very CGI which would be fine and it is not badly done, but seeing how amazing were the martial arts scenes I feel it is a missed opportunity there. Otherwise the acting is really solid here and like I said the story and the fight scenes were great.",POSITIVE
72,"Think of every cliché you can imagine in a film, and you'll still be very far. 'Reminiscence' is a cringe-fest. You probably heard of all the 'Chinatown' and 'Inception' comparisons, but this neo-noir attempt is absolutely boring and uninspiring. It reminded me of 'Gattaca', and made me appreciate it even more because this is just bad at so many levels. You'll stop caring about the plot halfway or before.",NEGATIVE
73,"Easily one of the Top 10 marvel movies to date. Compared to a puzzle, every piece in this movie fit perfectly into each other.",POSITIVE
74,This movie is adventurous and wonderful Simu Liu doesn’t great and the cast as well,POSITIVE
75,"Another Intellectual Property (IP) ruined by the hand of Jordan Peele (writer). Candyman 2021 is about as scary as a baby rabbit whereas the original excelled in this department. It's not a horror film anymore. And as for the original 1992 film it had a subtext that was brought through in a subtle and well-judged manner.

79,"10/10 IF you are are aware of gamer culture, not just play games. 8/10 if you only play games or don't care about games. Why? Free Guy is very ""meta."" This is a nearly perfect movie, polished to perfection due to the many release delays. I suggest audiences think about this as a movie about IMAGINATION more generally, instead of just games. This is another film with three or more big digital VFX houses contributing heavily. This means Sean Levy had the input, creativity and intelligence of three more TDs, Technical Directors. These films, ten or more of them now, have many, many masterful sequences even if the film as a whole doesn't work for everyone. Notable here is the Channing Tatum Badass ""intermission"" in the middle. This appears at exactly the place in the film where the sameness of the premise, characters and digital assets wears on audiences. To see this filmmaking flaw, watch Pixar's UP or Inside Out. Fewer AAA films since have this ""dead space"" lag prior to the third act. The Channing Tatum piece adds novelty and interest just when in the back of the audiences' mind, we're going yeah, yeah, yeah, so what? What else?"" I agree with Paul Stassi's Forbes piece reporting critics rate Free Guy over the Ready Player One film. I also agree Wreck-It Ralph is the next closest film to Free Guy. Free Guy is better because IT'S ABOUT IMAGINATION.",POSITIVE

82,"I'm happy to say that Shang-Chi is an enjoyable and heartfelt film that at times completely amazed me. The films first half was a little rocky and slow, but the latter half of the film really picks up the pace and the movie becomes something completely unique compared to other MCU films. The MCU definitely needed some fresh concepts, and Shang-Chi has plenty. If you want to see some well done fights, awesome visuals, and compelling characters, including a villain that is one of the MCU's best, watch Shang-Chi.",POSITIVE
83,"Movies with plots based around video games have been somewhere between mediocre and awful. Pixels wasn't the worst, the Super Mario Bros. movie had an odd charm, but they didn't blow me away. This...kind of did, but maybe not as Disney intended. I was a little skeptical of the movie's interactions with Youtubers in particular, wondering how much of an influence they'd actually make in the film. This film I think is fantastic for the audience of gamers, showcasing the importance of human interaction, and how games nowadays have gotten far better at embracing that part of gaming culture. It was still an entertaining film beyond this nailing of audience, however. Funny, quick humor, great acting, fun characters, keeps the audience going. I would absolutely recommend watching this film, especially if you're a gamer.",POSITIVE
84,"I didn't watch any trailers or teasers as I wasn't interested in any marvel projects after Endgame, but as the reviews started rolling in positively, I thought i'd check it out and it didn't disappoint! Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings is a fantastic origin movie, with on spot impressive visual effects, acting, pacing and characters. The story was fun to get along with, and the characters were very likeable. I'd say this did a better job than most Marvel solo origin films this time and I'm actually impressed by the character of Shang-Chi without prior knowledge and based solely on this adaptation! A fun weekend watch and memorable experience!",POSITIVE

87,"I typically start movies to abandon them ten minutes in if they suck, which is what I expected for this one. To my surprise, it was almost the movie I expected - but captivating from beginning to end. The photography is fabulous, the acting top notch throughout (seriously, casting should get a no holds barred party thrown for this accomplishment), it avoids all the cliches and sustains a thoughtful pace throughout. Surprise of the year. The only downside is that the story is told from beginning to end, there's not going to be a Kate 2.",POSITIVE
88,"Highly disappointed. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but a total let down. The first 5 minutes I thought was a bad commercial. If I would’ve known it was the movie at first I would’ve walked out. Absolutely ridiculous acting, the music was terrible, the storyline is just weird. There’s nothing about this movie that I found scary. More of a comedy or a spoof. I’m not really sure what they’re trying to do. I am a huge fan of the conjuring movies so this was a complete let down.",NEGATIVE
89,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to expand and become more diverse with this weekend's release of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. It is the first MCU theatrical release with a predominantly Asian cast. While it surely fits into the overall expanded universe, I can't tell you how it fits into whatever phase this is, but it is essentially Shang-Chi's origin story and, in that sense, it kind of can stand alone. The question is whether its worth trekking to the theater for all the action and drama - here's how we see it. Shang-Chi also known as ""Shaun"" (Simu Liu) has been an unassuming valet for years paling around with his best friend, Katy (Awkwafina) in San Francisco. On one fateful day as Shang-Chi and Katy are on their way to work, they get attacked by a group of thugs from the Ten Rings led by the goon, Razor Fist. Shang-Chi fends off the attackers in an impressive action sequence, but he exposes what he had otherwise hidden from Katy - kung-fu prowess and a history connected to those men that attacked him. From there, Shang-Chi and Katy set out on a quest to confront his past, protect his sister, and defeat his diabolical father who has had overwhelming power for a thousand years thanks to the titular Ten Rings. For most of these MCU films, what are we really looking for? Action. Comedy. Spectacle. A tie-in to the expanded universe. Shang-Chi delivers on most of that. Action - as a newcomer to the MCU, Simu Liu does a good job of setting up who Shang-Chi is and how he might fit into the larger group. The early fight sequences are exciting primarily because of Liu's athletic abilities. The kinetic energy brought to those set pieces are good enough to jolt some awake. Also, there is a fight between Tony Leung and Fala Chen early on that is a must see - it is quite awe-inspiring. When it comes to the MCU, the climactic battles are usually a mish-mosh and over-the-top, fortunately, this one is no different. Comedy - Liu also has good chemistry with Awkwafina - although the comedy is a bit lacking considering Awkwafina's reputation. There were not really any laugh out loud moments, but the easy tone of the film overall makes it generally enjoyable. It feels like they were trying for it, but it didn't hit the mark. Spectacle - the special effects here are pretty good. The power of the Ten Rings is interesting and the way they work into the action sequences works really well. The production design of Ta Lo is really beautiful to look at. Of course, Marvel Studios used their Marvel money to make the setting stand out. I can't say it is Black Panther impressive, but it was good nonetheless. In some ways, the movie gets a bit too stereotypical with Asian folks and dragons and never aging and then turning into dragons. There also is a tinge of this movie hearkening too close to Mulan in look and feel as if Disney was like we have some content we can save money on for this. Either way, I'm glad that Disney has opened minds to diversity with their live action films. Let's keep it up! Long story short, Marvel doesn't really make missteps and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is no different. The movie is a bit too long and Simu Liu might not have found his comedic legs yet. And still the movie is stereotypically enjoyable and well done by the MCU. I wonder how this will fit into the next phases of Marvel but until then I'll pick up a big box of popcorn as I ponder.",POSITIVE

92,The fact rhat the director and producers combed thru a WAREHOUSE of footage and we’re able to condense it down into a feature doc is a feat on its own. Especially in a time when platforms like Netflix are turning things like the 96-97 season of the Bulls into TEN HOURS of content. That’s in insanely less “content” than what Val compiled over 50+ years.

They should of built out the love story between her and the middle eastern lover more. You really didn’t care one way or the other is Matt or his daughter lived loved or died. They made Americans look bad and it just wasn’t realistic at all. Roughnecks make A LOT of money. Any American who makes 150-200k a year could afford 12,000 dollars for a private detective. It wasn’t realistic in the slightest. Matt Damon is carried bc his mom works at Harvard and he is part of the A lost friend circle but he ruined this movie. Another actor could of done amazing things with this material.",NEGATIVE
99,"The plot and general structure of the movie were pretty enjoyable. The rock really stands out as well, like he usually does. However the movie is horribly dragged down by how awful Emily Blunt's character is. She's presented as ""tough"" and ""persistent"" but really just comes across as arrogant and annoying. I can't help but thing the woke ""strong woman"" trope influenced the writing here. That being said, I'll give them credit for not shying away from knocking her down a few pegs and humiliating her a few times throughout the film. In fact those were my favorite parts, but it's a real problem when I, the viewer, are rooting against one of the main characters. The brother is a good comic relief, but Disney can't help themselves and made him gay for seemingly no reason that mattered in the film. Overall this film is pretty decent if you can get past Emily Blunt and the bit of wokeness.",POSITIVE

It is the perfect quiet indie movie that is about the smaller, intimate things in life. AND there's some genuinely surreal elements that make the entire film a bit off balance. The restaurant worker fight club scene is especially out of place, despite setting up a lot of the plot. Pig draws comparisons to Kelly Reichardt's work, though doesn't reach her success by a long shot. It's a great reason to see a movie, and it sticks with you.",POSITIVE

110,"I kinda feel this movie would've been perfect if the The Rock and Emily Blunt were switched out for much younger unpopular actors - honest. This feels like a great break out movie for any upcoming (promising) actor. I love Dwayne and Emily, they actually made this fun, but the love/bonding angle between the two would've worked better if played by much younger actors. I mean, Emily was just in A Quiet Place 2 earlier this year playing a mother with three kids and seeing her now taking on a Jane Porter-esque persona doesn't quite gel - at least not as well as it could've. In summary, Jungle Cruise feels like a marsh-up of elements from Tarzan, Pirates of The Caribbean, with a touch of The Mummy. There's treaure hunting, undead conquistadors, ancient South-American magic/technology, the amazingly lush Amazon jungle and Proxima! There's also Dwayne's occasional succinctly interjected hilarious word-play too. It's fun and interesting - an entertaining watch all round. Thank you, Disney. Now please, move on to a completely new project and don't ruin this piece of adventure with a money-motivated sequel.",POSITIVE
111,"A random and pointless film in which Nicolas Cage plays a hermit truffle hunter living in the woods with his beloved pig until she is kidnapped by thugs who work for a formal rival chef of his, and so he sets out to try and find her and bring her back. I was already wary of this one walking into it since at this point in his career, Cage indulges in self-parody with any film or role he takes on, and this one is definitely no exception. He looks washed-up, bored, and lost as he wanders aimlessly throughout most of this film alongside a snobby and sharply-dressed Alex Wolff. The story is ludicrous and seems to go nowhere, and there's no satisfaction or payoff of any kind that makes sitting through such an absurd premise of a film worth it in the end. Overall, it's really a waste of time despite some decent and committed performances from Cage and Wolff with the material they're given.",NEGATIVE
112,"This movie was an Absolute BORE. With a title like ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" you would think you would have a pretty good grasp of who Shang-Chi is and what the Ten Rings are. By the time the superfluous post-credits roll, you know virtually nothing about either of these things. Shang-chi is a bland, boring, cardboard cut-out of a character who knows a little bit of martial arts. The Ten Rings are ten rings that do power stuff and make you immortal. Where do they come from? What is their power? Why do they make you immortal? How did Shang-Chi's father acquire them? All these pivotal questions are unanswered and honestly by the end of the movie, I don't really care anyway. The best action that you would expect from an advertised as ""martial arts movie"" is in the first 30 mins. The bus scene was well done, despite at times coming off as clunky. It just made me want to see more and more impressive fight sequences. With the exception of 2-3 moments not long after, you won't see any more martial arts again. The movie proceeds to drag at a snail's paces for another 1.5 hours. Halfway through the film, for the first time ever, I checked the time to see how much more I had to endure. Shang-Chi's father and sister are confusing. Flip-flopping from wanting family togetherness to loathing everyone in the room with virtually no reason as to why. Best part of this movie was Awkwafina's Katy who was the ONLY character to have some semblance of a ""Hero's Journey"". Shang-Chi was not just a passenger in his own vehicle, he was virtually left behind to blend into the background. With the consistency of Disney/Marvel's subpar offerings beginning with WandaVision onward, I would either wait for this movie to be available for free (if you MUST watch it) or go back and watch the Infinity Saga over again for a much more enjoyable experience. The MCU died with Tony and Steve, it seems at this point like Disney is far too desperate to say goodbye when they had the chance.",NEGATIVE
113,Nice movie as a stand-alone but not so much as a second part. The story was a bit strange at points and the main character felt flat even after two films. The tension of the fight scenes made this film.,NEGATIVE
114,"Reminiscence is a Neo-noir film taking place when global warming has caused rising sea levels, socio-economic disparities have increased, and technology has been delivered for people to mentally re-live their past memories. If you enjoy the neo-noir genre, you should watch this film - even if it is not as good as it should have been. It is written, produced and directed by Lisa Joy who created Westworld with Jonathan Nolan. Lisa Joy is extremely creative - but, she doesn't have the broad skills to produce, cast and direct a complete project like this. The casting is off, the writing needed work to better fit the actors and the directing was not effective. And, I guess other things like editing and cinematography where good but were not excellent. If Lisa Joy wants to take a bigger role in producing her work, she should seek professionals who can help her. One last thing - Hugh Jackman is a good actor - but, I'm not a huge fan. He did not quite fit the role just right. Perhaps it was not entirely his fault. Perhaps Lisa Joy got off on the wrong foot when Hugh Jackman was cast in the lead role. I'll add that I add just finished watching a very dark Nordic-noir detective series just before I watched PG-13 rated Reminiscence. The stark difference between the two, especially with Hugh Jackman and his comic-book level charisma, made Reminiscence seem more of a teenager level material and less substantial and serious.",NEGATIVE

This is literally bad news, when you have Superhero franchises, where their so called 'God like' characters can die on screen. I still enjoyed this installment though but some of the set pieces are way too ridiculous to be taken seriously.

And that’s no knock on Split and I haven’t seen Glass yet. Old is a very enjoyable movie. The premise is unique, but often gets ahead of itself. Spoken dialogue is very choppy and unrealistic. Most of the speaking parts are spoken exposition which at times is very boring. But I’d be lying if I didn’t say I enjoyed the journey. It’s far from perfect. It’s no Signs or The Sixth Sense, but for anyone clamoring for some new M. Night, I definitely think it’s worth the price of admission - and more importantly, your time. Just know it’s clunky. It’s far from perfect. And I think what ruins the movie most is M. Night’s need to re-create his former glory.",NEGATIVE

123,"Long awaited and overdue, this week we have before you a name that must not be repeated more than 4 times. This weekend brought us the updated version and some could say sequel to, Candyman (2021). Disclaimer, I'm crazy but I'm not stupid. This name will not be uttered 5 times and nor am I looking into any reflective surfaces or eating honey while writing this review. With that said, C-man is what the producers are calling a 'spiritual sequel' to the horror classic Candyman (1992) that returns to the now-gentrified Chicago neighborhood where the legend began."" Let's see what they caught in their hook this time. Now, if you know then you really know, C-man has been haunting us for nearly 30 years. There are people today that won't say the name, watch the movies, or be in the dark with a mirror because of the original film, followed by some other scary-but-not-as-great sequels. Here, the most major knock to the film is a lack of originality in the scares. They gave us the classic slasher, thriller, suspense but it lacked pizazz. Maybe because I'm an adult and I may no longer be completely traumatized by the franchise's namesake, but I wasn't shook. Now, there will be some kids and pre-teens, and teens even, who may see this flick and get the goosebumps like we did back in the day, but I doubt it. Fortunately, and unfortunately, scary films over the last decade or more have moved on from fear to gore. We are in a trend now - thanks to Jordan Peele - of getting horror films that are overtly social commentary and this movie falls straight into that category. We get some of the gore and blood. We get some of the tension of who's lurking and chasing me. Even more so, we get that gentrification is coming/here visual horrors. While it's not bad, it's a bit too preachy in this movie to be scary. I think the film could've benefitted from more of the Get Out commentary through its visuals in order to add to the creepiness. This issue is also just present in the story of C-man itself. It's not necessarily a problem but it just seems that the writers just got too heavily focused on connecting the movie to a message rather than scaring the audience. A slight miss but not off-putting. Other than that, Candyman has a very good cast lead by Alpha man, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Teyonah Parris, and Colman Domingo. Each actor has scenes that stand out and show their range. I look forward to more films with them in it. Lastly, the movie set and scenery is just great. There are contrast and contradictions that show the idea of gentrification. The beauty of art and the meticulous placement of set design. Give me these apartments in Cabrini Green any day... without the haunting. Nevertheless, Candyman while a bit underwhelming in the fright category still delivers a solid performance. Will we talk about it like some have since 1992? Doubtful but this does keep a trend of solid productions by Jordan Peele, MonkeyPaw and Bron Studios. I look forward to more work from Nia DaCosta but Can….. Not happening. The flick gets a bowl of popcorn. Go see this movie in the daylight for a matinee price and make sure you check it out when it comes to streaming services in the comfort of your own dark home!",NEGATIVE
124,"Aside from the woke bull$hit, it's not scary, has a stupid story, and an overall boring film. The original was such a scary masterpiece and this abomination is a big slap in the face.",NEGATIVE
125,"A fun and enjoyable film but isn’t very good. This feels like a M. Night Shyamalan movie in both a good and bad way. Conceptually, the idea is really interesting. There are a ton of cool ideas that are being tossed around here and some of them feel cool and others feel half baked. The cinematography is really great at points but the editing and some shots can be nauseating. The performances all ALL over the place. The mother is awful while Thomasin McKenzie is weird but the schizophrenic Doctor is great. It’s just weird that there is almost no consistency within the performances and writing. The moral implication of some of these ideas are really weird. If a child ages rapidly, do they have the concept of consent. I say this because one of the children that ages gets pregnant from one of the other kids. It’s really really weird at points like that. M. Night is known to have some cool twists, either really great or so bad that it’s funny, but this was fine. It wasn’t earth shattering but it was an interesting idea. Some of the dialogue is laughable bad at points and the film doesn’t always make sense. There is one person on the beach who has been there for a while but he doesn’t age like the other characters and it’s never explained. There is also an issue with how stabbing works in this film but that dives too much into spoilers about the film. This is definitely an entertaining experience and I would recommend watching this if you want a good laugh.",POSITIVE
126,"Shang-Chi is a movie that nobody expected. An exemplar with which we were not familiar that, not only knew how to exploit their low expectations to the maximum extent, but also developed a structured and dynamic narrative immersed in a MCU that does not leave much room for new heroes. Shang-Chi made its first appearance in Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin's “Special Marvel Edition # 15” (December 1973). A Kung-Fu master created in the middle of the genre's boom in the US in the 1970s, Shang-Chi is quite a quirky character. Played by Simu Liu, the protagonist is embarked on an adventure after being intercepted by ghosts from his past. Full of action, martial arts and a very own and attractive aesthetic, the film unfolds without delay. The scenes are punctual and always add something new. Even with a sense of humor that can get heavy on certain occasions (such as when Katy makes jokes in the middle of life and death situations), Shang-Chi finds its essence, exploits it and ends with a gold ribbon leaving the door open for future aftermath. Marvel and its production team never cease to amaze me with their new films. In a difficult transition period, given the conclusion of the Infinity Saga and the beginning of this new phase, the studio keeps its feet on the ground and continues a coherent thread of its interconnected universe. Regardless of the obvious mentions to the events of ""Avengers Endgame"", Marvel returns to do what it does best: including thousands of references, cameos and winks that leave the geeks like me open-mouthed and with the greed for more. The cast is incredible. I did not know any of the actors beforehand and they all dazzled me with their distinctive personalities and professional interpretations. The studio made a great work in synthetizing the oriental culture´s mythology and beliefs. However, it is true that Shang-Chi continues to be a westernized vision of Asian cultures due to its falls into stereotypes of martial arts and frequent characterizations of the Eastern world in Hollywood. Despite this and to my surprise, Shang-Chi knows how to combine the best of both worlds, using humor as its best tool and taking its time to tell the story, avoiding the rush to get to the action sequences that movies of this kind have suffered The protagonist's arc is round and fulfilling. It has cohesion and is true to its ideals from beginning to end. Thus, the villain (excellently played by Tony Leung) only contributes to the plot and does not fall into the corner of un-memorable Marvel villains. We send you a greeting, Fake Mandarin. If it hadn't been for the blessing acting skills of RDJ, no one would remember your existence. Furthermore, the film interprets the concept of ""grays"" very well. In a franchise that is ""infantilized"" at times, Shang-Chi does not stutter in telling the hard truths of reality such as unsatisfactory employment, unreal family expectations, childhood trauma, the dilemma about murder, among others. Heroes are not pure white. They have their shortcomings, they fight with their demons and that makes them more credible, more human. With a stellar sound-track, Shang-Chi is one of Marvel's most unexpected gems. It is amazing to feel and denote the love with which these films are made and the fidelity to the source materials. For example, the main character's leitmotif is a work of art and a composition that immerses us even more in the plot. Kevin Feige deserves all the praise, he is truly a man who knows how to sell his product very well and, at the same time, sell us something with great qualitative value. After the post-credits scenes, fans only crave more and rejoice in the near future for what remains of this phase. Now with the recent release of the trailer for the new Spiderman movie, one only has to cross out the days for its premiere and admire the attention to detail that they put into the making of the films, not only as individual creations, but as a large adjoining and a special set of films.

133,"A beautiful film where the time is taken to thoroughly explore the story of the main character. While the story gets off to a slow start, it is eventually expanded into an emotional portrait. Mat Damon plays excellently and gives his character weight within the plot. The realistic ending ultimately makes it an excellent film. Just don’t expect a action filled plot.",POSITIVE
134,"In Annette, director Leos Carax maximizes on its artifice and melodrama to explore more profound truths than a dozen movies of one “cinematic universe” can deliver these days. Annette, after all, is mostly represented by just a wooden marionette caught in the midst of a chorus of sound, fury, and every possibly stormy connotation in between. But even at the start, the film incorporates itself into a surreal world of odd musicality ruled by familiar figures of violently toxic masculinity — too often excused and encouraged to indulge a mythos of ""tortured genius"" — providing an uncomfortable mirror to our times in spite of some levity from their sung-along dialogue.",POSITIVE
135,"Kept waiting for this to make sense and it never got there. I’m all for twisty scenarios where, at the end, you go “ahhhh!!” At the end of this, you go “huh?” Glad I didn’t pay anything for this movie. It would have been a waste of money. The only redeeming feature was seeing Hugh Jackman shirtless.",NEGATIVE
136,"GI Joe was never my thing when I was growing up. My only experience with this IP was the two big blockbuster GI Joe movies and they were terrible. Snake Eye was the best aspect of those terrible movies though as he was a badass mute ninja. I was a little surprised and intrigued when it was announced that there would be a prequel/reboot focused on him before he was mute. The premise is ""An ancient Japanese clan called the Arashikage welcomes tenacious loner Snake Eyes after he saves the life of their heir apparent. Upon arrival in Japan, the Arashikage teach him the ways of the ninja warrior while also providing him something he's been longing for: a home. However, when secrets from Snake Eyes' past are revealed, his honour and allegiance get tested -- even if that means losing the trust of those closest to him"". So is the Snake Eye origin a story worth telling or is it just another bad attempt at the GI Joe franchise? Firstly, Henry Golding is good as the titular character. It is clear that Henry is giving 100% in every scene. There is an emotional moment in the final act and Henry gives a very convincing performance during it. Andrew Koji is also great as Tomisaburo Arashikage/Storm Shadow. He has a really strong voice and presence that is great to watch. I also love the moments between Henry's Snake Eye and Andrew's Storm Shadow. The chemistry between the two is great and it does feel like they were close friends or brothers. I also really like the gorgeous set design from the Japanese style of the Arashikage base to the neon-filled city. There is also a pretty good action sequence with long takes in the rain at a neon-drenched alleyway that was visually good to watch. Unfortunately, the rest of the action sequences in this film are forgettable. The director, Robert Schwentke, implements shaky cam during close-ups of fights and also uses a ton of quick cuts which ruins the scene. It's such a shame as the alleyway fight scene shows that he could easily do entertaining fights but doesn't. The music score is also very generic with this electronic thump sound throughout the movie that occurs in action and even non-action scenes. The biggest issue with this movie has got to be the terrible screenplay and story. The titular character, Snake Eyes, is an unlikeable main character that is difficult to root for. Without spoiling things, he does questionable things for the sake of revenge for the death of his father. Additionally, his redemption arc happens right at the very end of the movie and by that point, I could not like his character anymore. He didn't deserve any forgiveness whatsoever. Furthermore, Tomisaburo becomes the famous GI Joe villain, Storm Shadow, through some stupid logic. The first two acts of the movie is a grounded ninja, martial art movie but the final act is a tonal shift with it feeling more in line with superhero movies with silly magical power garbage. Overall, Snake Eyes: GI Joe origins is the best GI Joe movie so far but it is still a bad movie. This movie succeeds in ruining the titular character by turning him into a dumb idiot. It also has forgettable action sequences that feel more aligned with generic action movies than the famed martial art movies. I don't know if this will get a sequel or another reboot in 10 years but I hope the next entry is a lot better than this...",POSITIVE

No. It had its problems but it didn't deserved so much negativity. Only giving negative reviews because movie was almost same story and policies is wrong.

142,"Winston Duke’s character is a sort of cross between the stork and a guardian angel. He sits in a craftsman house in the desert, watching the people he “birthed” on old TVs, while recording momentous events on VHS (the retro tech is never explained). When one of his charges dies unexpectedly, 5 new entities (unborn souls?) must interview to become a human. Duke heads a cast of actors who stretch their dramatic talents with involving performances, including Tony Hale, Zazie Beetz and Bill Skarsgård. This is one of those tedious, pretentious experiments that may appeal to people who like esoteric, poetic musings on life. For the rest of us, the pace is deadly and there isn’t really a story, just a string of mind games disguised as tests (and dramatic opportunities for the actors). First time writer/director Edson Oda presents a unique vision and a promising point of view, but not one that will appeal to many mainstream moviegoers.",NEGATIVE

While not as exciting as it's predecessors it is still a great 6th installment to the Bourne series, there is clear effort made by the writers to return Stillwater to the roots of the Bourne series and this movie almost entirely glosses over the non-sensical events of the 5th film in which Jason had became trapped on Mars.",NEGATIVE

But in this day and age it feels cheap and tacky.. complete with an evil German, a jaguar that understands complete sentences, and whatever was left on the cutting room floor of The Mummy, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Indiana Jones.. not in a good way.. but thrown together in the most random bucket of wtf. And while I support a little bit of wokeness, it was clearly tacked on for marketing points. Lastly, it was too violent for kids, but too purile for teens.

149,"Terrible. An attempt to shoe horn in some sort of heart beat without creating any proper character development. Family moments are now forced through terrible dialogue, harsh frowns and strained looks of concern. With the series at number 9, the writers have elected to create more history without creating a connection for the audience. As a result, we're left feeling nothing for what these characters have experienced. Some of the talent is wasted, with Charlize Theron spending half the film in a glass box before miraculously escaping for the finale of the film. Nothing here makes sense. Cars now flip semi trailers and falling characters are regularly caught using the bonnet of the nearest car. I resent this film because of what it could have been and the stain it has left on an otherwise good run of films. With such a big budget someone should have had the balls to tell Justin Lin ""Stop and let the film breath for a second"".",NEGATIVE

Inappropriate: Filled with dirty language I counted more than 20 plus obscene gestures, sick physical interaction between Matty and Guy, I'm going to have to edit this movie a bunch so my kid siblings can watch it. Cringe: needed more consultants who were actual gamers and programmers. Both main characters admitted they don't have video games in their house besides words with friends. It was obvious memes were the reference material rather than actual gaming or coding. From the trailer, I was hoping this would redeem Ryan Reynolds from the fart joke that is Deadpool.

If you watch movies for the visuals and not the story or drama this is the movie for you. If interesting stories, drama, or plot are what you like this movie is a solid 0-3 out of 10 depending on how much you like art films.",NEGATIVE

Trailer really set the expectations with the visuals and cool soundtrack. And there are some nice shots and ideas but in general there is no suspense whatsoever and the social commentary is super naive and taking the whole thing to the extreme. It appears that Candyman(or -men actually) is only killing white people (which are all villains in this movie) and he's actually used as a weapon in some crazy revenge strategy. There are some cool, creative ideas, like few death scenes, but they are all very poorly executed with wrong pacing and soundtrack.",NEGATIVE

This film was slow, didn't really have much to say about itself apart from the good old ""white person is bad"" (cheers Jordan Peale, you seem to love this ehh) - This seemed to have no direction, I can see how it's been linked with the first films through the backstory that is shown, I liked that part but wow, was this film boring! I was sat waiting for the tension to build up but it never got there. I was excited to see Tony Todd reappear again as I knew he would be in it but he just makes an appearance in the last 20 seconds of the film (maybe CGI) as if to show that a sequel would be coming. The ending is so unsatisfying, no conclusion to tie up this one film but just a hint that there will be another film to conclude. I've never been this disappointed with a cinema trip in a long time.",NEGATIVE
164,"What starts as a fun idea soon fizzles out once the ensemble of townsfolk are introduced. The film becomes irredeemably forgettable once the realisation sets in that you won't see a werewolf at all until the last seven minutes or so.

This film seemed to be setting its sights higher, but fell flat. Rebecca Hall plays a woman whose husband committed suicide. The film begins as she returns to their lakeside home, but then come the hallucinations. It’s peppered with typical mild jump scares and creepy specters, but is never scary or even tense. The revelations are never fully explored and to make matters even more unfulfilling, the ending is completely useless and confusing.",NEGATIVE

173,"I genuinely wasn't gonna see this in theaters despite the stellar reviews (due to COVID concerns), but unexpectedly got a day off and decided, wth why not? And I was so pleasantly surprised and taken aback by how moved I was...and just how much I loved it overall. The trailers had not gotten me at all. But the characters were perfect, the emotion hit me hard...I found myself tearing up inexplicably early on. It was just so beautifully made, felt so genuine and human. Honestly, and I mean this as a praise, it didn't feel like a Marvel movie (for the most part); it just felt like a good story. Definitely one of the better movies, I think, in the entire MCU. So well done to everyone involved",POSITIVE
174,"It's easy for sports movies to fall into the trap of being corny, cliched and trite. However, director Quentin Reynaud's second feature takes the genre a step further, serving up an engaging, thoughtful character study about an aging French tennis star (and onetime prodigy) seeking to finally live up to his potential before his failing physical condition forces him into retirement. In doing so, however, he must not only deal with those ailments, but also face the psychological demons that have dogged him throughout his career. While some elements of the story are a little repetitive and occasionally predictable, the film nevertheless offers viewers a fresh take on issues like drive, obsession and the price we're willing to pay to realize a cherished goal, no matter what the milieu. The picture's fine performances, ethereal score and artfully filmed tennis matches mix well, adding to a narrative that seeks to go beyond the expected and ordinary. ""Final Set"" definitely delivers more than what one might anticipate, advancing a genre that all too often takes the easy route, and one can hardly find fault with that.",POSITIVE
175,"Shyamalan continues his positive streak that has been going on since ""the visit"" with this film that fully respects his style. Dazzling direction, absurd characters and grotesque elements.

178,"Yesterday, I read on Indiewire, that CODA could potentially turn out to be an Academy Award contender, and I couldn't help but laugh. I just couldn't believe it, because the film has nothing especial. It's well made, but Oscar material? Hell no. If you read other reviews, and bypass the inclusion theme, you will realize The Bélier Family, the film of which CODA is a remake, seems to be ignored or looked down upon. Also if you see the difference in rankings on Rotten Tomatoes, you will realize The Bélier Family, has lower ratings. Even though it's the same thing. This movie is basically 90% the same stuff. The changes are slight, and don't matter in the overall concept, so I'm surprised, I'm really surprised that it's being so praised and recognized for something the original film already did. I mean, The Bélier Family was released barely seven years ago, it's not that old, and it was very successful, so I don't get why CODA all of the sudden is a better film. It's incredible too see that the story of a triumphant but inconsequential French film ended up becoming for the US press, an academy award contender once the Americans remade it. I'm baffled. I just can remember the words the great Bong Joon-Ho said: ""Once you get past the subtitle barrier, you will see much more amazing movies."" Especially the original ones.",POSITIVE

180,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings was just a masterpiece, every second was visually gorgeous and it's amazing to Asian Culture being explored and represented in the media more and more especially in a genre that doesn't. The fight choreography and action scenes were impeccable, just so clean and awesome; maybe the best fight choreography I've ever seen and some of the best action scenes ever. The performances from Simu Liu, Meng'er Zhang, Awkwafina, Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, and Ben Kingsley were outstanding. The visual effects were phenomenal from the Great Protector to the Shishi to the Dweller-in-Darkness, just some of the best visual effects I've ever seen. The writing was stupendous, the screenplay and story were just superb and the character development especially with Shang-Chi was terrific. The costumes were spectacular. The makeup and hairstyling was great. Also the music was great. An A+ movie and it is definitely in my top 3 favorite movies I've ever seen now.",POSITIVE
181,"My expectations were perhaps too big in the face of the very basic drama that Tom McCarthy ends up delivering. All the execution, drama, tension and mystery are from inside the box. There's no outside thinking for more engaging ideas. Even Matt Damon's good performance is just normal and moderate, nothing exceptional, just him doing his job in a good way. While Abigail Breslin isn't given much that she can explore and it's understandable, because Damon is the star, but certainly everything around him is too conventional and one-dimensional. The drama is entertaining, it's true, but it's also absolutely ordinary. What it builds is totally predictable, this even despite the quality. That's why Stillwater feels like a movie that plays all its card in the safest way possible, and never tries to risk anything. Only the conclusion gives it a different depth because it gives another perspective to what Damon's character risked, but that's only in the final minutes. By then it's already too late to improve its impression",NEGATIVE
182,"The acting is great but the storyline is just a little boring/predictable at times.

185,"It was okay, but definitely not the best Marvel movie. Just like in the comics, Shang Chi is not explored very much as a person, but only as a non-stop action machine; and while the fights are impressive, it felt like a very by-the-books Hollywood flick. You got the sappy backstory, the comic relief, the merchandiseable creatures, the fight scenes with no consequences, the double final battle - everything you’ve seen before, it’s there, but at least it’s done well. That can be said about most of the Marvel movies in my opinion, but with recent shows like Loki and WandaVision, I was really hoping the movie would have had more creativity and personality. It was okay while it lasted, but the next time I see Shang Chi on screen, I’m probably not gonna remember much of what happened during this movie.",NEGATIVE

190,"Oh boy… where to start with this one. Walking out the cinema no less than four couples questioned wether or not what they had just seen was a terrible dream, or that we were on some form of reality show, with cameramen secretly recording our reactions. The two people in the toilet cubicles discussing what was worse, the acting, story or premise, or the girls mentioning that they should have watched a trailer first - this was a strange experience just walking out of a film to murmurings of what we all had just witnessed (one that I could only presume had the same profound affect as cult classic ‘The Room’). The movies premise is actually a really interesting one, something very unique and unlike any horrors recently so for this I have given the film at least a 1, that’s about as good as I can give this film. Some of the character choices (not in a dumb movie type trope) just seem to be poorly written, a great example of this is the main character suffers a tragedy in Act 1, her mother does not even turn up in the film until around half way through not even questioning anything she has gone through (odd choice, bad mother). To some domestic abuse being shoehorned in which in reality sets up the movie but this could have been done in so many other less jarring ways. The acting is absolutely atrocious with some poor attempts at some jokes thrown in, basically the structure around this absolutely mental film essentially does not support its unique interesting premise, leaving it looking like a C rated horror movie where if it was available to stream for free I would want my money back.",NEGATIVE

By relying on a verbose script and boring exposition scenes, the cinematography and photography, which should be the core of its art, only flickers here and there, as symbolic embers of his dying inspiration. Cotillard is as usual acting herself and insufferable as ever while Driver is of course a brooding faux-romantique caricature of himself. It's even worse than Chazelle's La La Land!",NEGATIVE

195,"With all of the talk about mental health that has dominated the public dialogue of late, the subject has been imbued with a newfound seriousness, something not to be taken lightly. Unfortunately, this misguided offering fails miserably on that point, especially in the film's opening half, attempting to defuse the weight of this subject by incorporating humor that borders on flippant and flops massively. In this story of an aspiring writer seeking to relocate to Paris to become a novelist, the protagonist suddenly finds himself having to take in and care for his unpredictable schizophrenic sister, derailing his plans and reinforcing a pattern of misfortune that has followed him throughout his life. But, even with the best of intentions for his sister's welfare, he quickly becomes afflicted with caregiver burnout as he sees his dream evaporate and watches his sibling descend deeper into the depths of mental illness. To its credit, the film gets remarkably better in the second half, mainly because it finally starts to take itself seriously. However, by that point, the damage is done, and there's not enough for the production to effectively redeem itself. A woefully missed opportunity.",NEGATIVE
196,"There's some good photography in here, and the social premise is not that bad — you know what you're getting into when you walk into something involving Jordan Peele —. The problem is that there are too many ideas, and I really don't get what Nia DaCosta and Peele were trying to do with the character. It also doesn't help that the themes are in-your-face all the time. Some subtlety could've helped a little. And, of course, the last act is the worst part of the film; I liked the gory scenes, but the ending is very underwhelming and confusing.",NEGATIVE
197,"shang chi review no spoilers I saw shang chi the new marvel film with an oriental tone.The strongest point of the film is the plot that manages to tell (although in the first few bars I was not convinced) a simple story, easy to understand and linear.The soundtrack does not make you scream to the miracle but it is still good and accompanies the scenes well. These latter are some very beautiful, others instead made me turn up my nose. The main flaw of the film is the poorly detailed characters (apart from shang chi) albeit justified by a good cast. One thing that I have not endured instead is that they have wasted the character of ..... guys I really don't know what it's called forgive me (the masked one like taskmaster)",POSITIVE

Overall, it was a bit too convoluted for my liking. It just didn't keep me enthused.",NEGATIVE
201,"When it comes to writer-director Tom McCarthy's latest offering, one can't help but wonder, is this the story of an amateur crime investigation or the touching tale of a father with a past seeking redemption? Well, it appears to be some of both and not much of either. Based loosely on the headline-grabbing story of American college student Amanda Knox, who was falsely convicted of murder and imprisoned in Italy, this fictional work employs a similar narrative, with the venue relocated to France and supplemented by the accused's roughneck Oklahoma dad seeking to find the perpetrator in the slums of Marseilles. In the course of his investigation, he meets, befriends and moves in with a single mother and her young daughter, who help him with his sleuthing and provide him with an opportunity to redeem himself for past transgressions and oversights. However, these two story threads don't mesh particularly well and never quite engage the audience as effectively as they could have. And, despite the excellent lead performance of Matt Damon and the fine supporting portrayals of Camille Cottin and Lilou Siauvaud, any speculation that this overlong saga could be an early Oscar contender is significantly overblown. The film has also drawn considerable criticism from Ms. Knox, who contends that the production is profiting from her story and conveying false impressions about her character and reputation, despite official claims that this is purely a work of fiction. In any event, ""Stillwater"" falls far short of expectations in many respects, and viewers would be wise to bear that in mind before taking the time to give this one a look.",NEGATIVE

I went into this one with moderately low expectations, having only watched the trailer once, and I gotta say that I was not at all prepared for just how cringy and flat-out bad this film would turn out to be, even with my low expectations. What starts off in the first half as a mysterious psychological horror thriller (and a surprisingly slow one at that) quickly dives headfirst into absolutely absurd supernatural slasher horror schlock, complete with terrible cgi and effects. On top of that, terrible and hammy acting is provided from practically everybody involved here, with several moments coming off as unintentionally hilarious often times due to the actors and their line delivery. The final act was really just something else, and not in a good way at all. I can't remember the last time a film jumped the shark in its final act worse than this one, and the ending, like the rest of the film, was just cheesy, predictable, and completely unsatisfying. Overall, this was not only not scary and full of cheap jump scares, gore, and forced comic relief moments, but it also just reaffirms my belief that this is why the horror genre has been slowly dying over the years.",NEGATIVE
203,"Un bon film, bien meilleur que ceux qui sont sortis ces derniers mois et cela en dit long.",NEGATIVE
204,"This movie is full of pure stupidity, it completely retcons what we know of this man and try turning him into a hero and it does not stick to the landing. Then… it goes from horror to some action movie thriller. It ignores everything from the first movie. The first movie did not need a sequel whatsoever the second half of the movie is even more terrible than the first half. Spend your time doing something more interesting than sitting through this trash.",NEGATIVE
205,There must be a reason not to love this movie? We are literally facing one of the best of the superhero genre.,POSITIVE
206,"When an enigmatic massage therapist/hypnotist from the Chernobyl area of Ukraine shows up in an upscale Polish gated community, he miraculously attends to the healing of an assortment of residents with varying physical and emotional needs. But who is he really, especially in light of his special powers that make him seem like a subdued but otherworldly superhero? That's the gist of this atmospheric tale from directors Malgorzata Szumowska and Michal Englert, which seamlessly weaves drama, science fiction and delightful humor in a modestly intriguing story, thanks in large part to the fine lead performance of Alec Utgoff. However, despite an engaging premise, captivating back story and colorful supporting characters, the film's deliberate ambiguity gets stretched quite thin after a while, leaving viewers wonder exactly where this film is going, with a concluding payoff that's somewhat less than satisfying. As a vehicle that seems quite self-satisfied with itself for its beautifully filmed but nevertheless cryptic nature, the filmmakers have left the audience somewhat in the dark with some of their meandering, underdeveloped and unexplained narrative choices. The result is a film that probably should have gone through an additional round of script changes and final edits before being released, alterations that would have made for a much more satisfying picture.",NEGATIVE
207,"Do you remember the time when we fell in love? Do you remember the time that you first read Stream to Big Screen, girl! OH AYE! Sorry, I got caught up in my memories of that song. Anyway, this weekend a new movie premiered in theaters and on HBO Max, Reminiscence. Also known as The Jade Earring, Reminiscence is a mystery/thriller/love story that follows Hugh Jackman as Nick Bannister, a private investigator of the mind as he navigates the alluring world of the past when his life is changed by new client Mae. A simple case becomes an obsession after she disappears and he fights to learn the truth about her. I know what you're already thinking. An investigator of the mind?! Yes, it's reminiscent of an all time great, Inception. Is this a review within a review within a review? No. We are just talking about how Reminiscence has borrowed a storyline but with a strangely unoriginal while nicely executed story. And by nicely executed, I don't mean how slowly this movie unravels so obviously. I mean who doesn't love a who done it? The story unfolds in a way that you feel each character. I found myself either lusting after Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) or eagerly seeking answers like Hugh. One might say that was just the actors doing a really good job, which I won't deny. Let's not talk about how Thandie Newtown was grossly misused and underutilized. I also think it is a testament to how generally good the direction and the writing are. With that said, I feel like the movie could have been cut a bit to make it quicker and more hard hitting. Of course, there are times where we need to linger but there were definitely times where the movie held on too long to a part we don't really care about. The biggest misstep of this movie comes with the scenery though. Why in the heck did the world need to have water everywhere?! Honestly, this movie only had one cool scene in the water and the rest of the movie could've been dry. It sticks out like a sore thumb and quite frankly makes zero sense. Why does everyone have to have soggy socks and athlete's foot? Sorry, I may be looking at this too realistically but the water setting is the biggest why the heck was this necessary at the end of the movie. The other misstep of this movie is that while the twist and turns of the story are pretty good, the result is just so unsatisfying. I feel like there was no payoff at the end of the movie. The movie does give a nice, loving ending, but the chase for the Maltese falcon of who done it was just so... who cares. Reminiscence, at the end of the day, is a solid seductive toxic relationship with an okay who done it. The actors make the movie worth watching with their chemistry and delivery. Yet, at the end of the day, half of the movie seems completely unimportant. Reminiscence is a nice ride for a streaming movie, but I could see how a moviegoer would be disappointed. Streamers grab yourself a bowl while those of you loving the movie theaters again don't brave the Delta for this flick but run to HBO Max.",NEGATIVE
208,"What Jennifer Hudson achieves with this perfomance is otherworldly, her portrayal of Aretha Franklin is legendary, and the film is extraordinary",POSITIVE
209,"Kate is 2021 great surprise, with an amazing performance by all the cast especially Mary Elizabeth Winstead, fantastic cinematography, and Japan as always been a perfect place, Kate is gory, bloody, intense, fills with great action-packed, and interesting story, Kate is surprisingly a very solid movie.",POSITIVE
210,"I once said after watching Black Panther, that it would be cool if there was an all Asian cast similar to it. There were some all Asian cast movies like Crazy Rich Asian (2018), but that is a romcom, and Mulan (2020), but that was bad. In comes Shang Chi which is the first Asian lead Superhero movie ever. Firstly, the action sequences and choreography are some of the best from Marvel since Captain America and the Winter Soldier (2014). Martial arts are the focus of the action scenes in Shang Chi and they are beautifully choreographed. We get the classic wire-fu/floating style of Crouching Tiger but we also get some Jackie Chan style with the utilization of the environment for the action. Each action scene is memorable and stunning to watch. Additionally, the action scenes avoid using lots of cuts and shaky cam which I was so grateful for. It is also clear that the actors themselves rehearsed the choreography making the fights feel more believable and gratifying. It does become a more typical MCU action sequence by the third act but even that is still pretty enjoyable even if it isn't as good as the first two acts. The cinematography by Bill Pope (Matrix trilogy, Spiderman 2 and 3, Scott Pilgrim) is also excellent in Shang Chi. Skyscrapers and forests in Marvel movies have never looked as good as it has in Shang Chi. Bill pope and director Destin use the lighting and colours very effectively and allow for some genuinely beautiful shots. The music score by Joel P. West is also pretty good. Joel utilizes more electronic sounds and pop/rap songs for the scenes in the city but uses more traditional Asian instruments for the mystical areas. Joel's score captures the scene and the pop/rap songs themselves are also quite good albeit not as memorable as the Weeknd or Lamar from Black Panther. I also love the story and exploration of ""family"" with Shang Chi whilst not using Asian stereotypes. It also doesn't overuse humour like in Marvel's previous outing, Black Widow (2021), where they use jokes every couple of minutes and ruin a serious scene. Shang Chi thankfully avoids doing this, thus allowing the emotion of a scene to linger longer. There are still jokes though but they are genuinely quite funny. Furthermore, Simu Liu is charismatic, charming and cool as the titular character Shang Chi. I think Marvel succeeds again in the casting department as Simu Liu delivers on making me believe that this guy is a top tier martial artist. I also think Simu gives a good performance during the more emotional moments as well. His chemistry with Awkwafina who plays Shang Chi's friend Katy is great too. The banter between Shang Chi and Katy is some of the funniest scenes and makes me believe that those two were friends for years. However, Tony Leung who plays the main villain Wenwu (the real Mandarin) is the one that steals the show. Tony Leung is just phenomenal as he can convey the exact emotions of his character just through body language alone, it is just masterful acting. My biggest worry with MCU origin movies is that the villains are lacklustre but Shang Chi does not fall into this. Wenwu is very sympathetic but also extremely fearsome. He is also the father of Shang Chi which makes the conflict between them feel more meaningful and tragic. Wenwu is not a straight-up evil person as he does still have good in him and I like that. Unfortunately, Shang Chi suffers from having the 3 villain problem. Razorfist played by Florian is Wenwu's henchman and he doesn't get any backstory. I don't mind him that much though as he is mostly there to chase Shang Chi like a 007 henchman. There is also a scene where he does seem visibly worried about Wenwu's health which gives him some character depth. On the other hand, the 3rd villain Death Dealer who is a mysterious assassin of Wenwu is a massive disappointment. He looks very cool and visibly distinct from other ten ring members and is relevant to Shang Chi's past but amounts to absolutely nothing. Moreover, there is also a 3rd hero to Shang Chi and Katy with Shang Chi's sister Xialing played by Meng'er Zhang. She doesn't get enough interactions with Shang Chi, Katy or her father Wenwu and that feels like a waste. It's a shame as her interactions with both Shang Chi and Katy are enjoyable and she also doesn't interact with her dad Wenwu which is just a missed opportunity for her character. The movie also has a pacing issue as it slows down significantly in the second act. It just featured a lot of talking, exposition and flashbacks which I felt could have been cut down by a couple of minutes. Overall, Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the all Asian cast movie I have been waiting for. It delivers on the action, story and characters while being an exciting new addition to the MCU. I can't wait to see more of Shang Chi and finally get to see an Asian in the Avengers team.",POSITIVE

Kudos to Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who seemed to have trained hard for this and it showed. Lot of kinetic energy and very colorful action made it visually appealing until that wore off, and I started paying attention to what was a pretty bland plot. I think they were going in the right direction, but about half to 3/4 into the movie, I felt myself reaching for my phone. By the end, I had no idea what was going on, and didn't really care. Wouldn't mind seeing Winstead in another action movie, though. She certainly showed her chops.",POSITIVE

217,"Jungle Cruise (2021) is another attempt at making a movie franchise based on one of their rides at their theme parks. The only real success so far has been Pirates of the Caribbean. Most of the time it is Tomorrowland (2015) or The Haunted Mansion (2003). The premise is ""Dr Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) enlists the aid of wisecracking skipper Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) to take her down the Amazon in his ramshackle boat. Together, they search for an ancient tree that holds the power to heal -- a discovery that will change the future of medicine"". So is this more close to Pirates of the Caribbean or Tomorrowland? Firstly, Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt truly carry this film. Dwayne's scoundrel and charismatic performance surprisingly works well with Emily's posh and outgoing performance. Both have great chemistry together and when they are both bantering with one another, it is enjoyable to watch. The majority of the movie is about the characters on the boat which is what the ride is about. So I do appreciate the fact that they did attempt to keep it faithful to the ride it was inspired by. Jungle Cruise feels like a 90s movie but that is not quite a bad thing in this case. It is advertised as a fun family adventure movie and I do believe it succeeds in that aspect. There are some silly but fun jokes that mostly land and there are over the top action sequences that are fun to watch. We get the 90s comic relief guy and even over the top villains as well. For the most part, it does feel old fashioned but it works and I can definitely see families enjoying Jungle Cruise. There are also some really nice twists and revelations that genuinely surprised me as well. However, the plot is a bit messy in its execution. For example, it takes quite a while for the Jungle Cruise to actually start and even when it has finally started, there is a lot of downtimes that don't advance the plot. The film's length is over 2 hours and it feels way too long. The movie could have easily cut 15-20 minutes of runtime and made it a better film, pacing wise. Dwayne's character, Frank Wolff, is the cliche cynical and shrewd character who is initially unlikeable but gets better later. Jungle Cruise takes almost over halfway in the movie before he actually becomes likeable which was way too long in my opinion. Jungle Cruise also has a villain problem as there are two villains in this film. Aguirre, the cursed Spanish conquistador, who wanted the tree's power to save his daughter but is now immortal and Prince Joachim who is some german guy. Both are chasing the protagonist but Prince Joachim himself feels like a giant waste of screen time even though he appears more than Aguirre. You could cut Prince Joachim and the plot is still the same, that is how irrelevant his character is. Jungle Cruise (2021) has an abundant amount of CGI. It feels like CGI was the first solution to everything by the director and it shows. It wouldn't be as jarring if the CGI itself was good. Unfortunately, this is not the case as the CGI is very noticeable and not great by 2021 standards. The shots, editing and cinematography are also disappointing average and never feel like it tries to do more with it despite it being a big blockbuster. However, the music score by James Newton Howard has got to be the most disappointing aspect of Jungle Cruise. James has done scores for many great films such as King Kong (2005), Unbreakable (2000), Fantastic Beast franchise etc. For some reason, James gives a very weak score for Jungle Cruise (2021). There is no soundtrack here that sticks in my mind and it has no iconic theme like Pirates of the Caribbean. Overall, Jungle Cruise is a fun action and adventure film that is reminiscent of classic 90s films such as The Mummy (1999) but never as good. Thanks to the chemistry of Dwayne and Emily, the Jungle Cruise manages to stay afloat to keep you engaged but it certainly ends up being a very generic and forgettable movie. Nevertheless, it is better than a lot of Disney's previous outings that were based on theme park rides. Not as good as Pirates of the Caribbean but better than Tomorrowland which is a huge step forward.",POSITIVE

220,"Recently, creative teams apparently have found it irresistible to explore what it means to be human by writing scripts that insert people into video games. Spielberg’s “Ready Player One” (2018) and the Matthew McConaughey vehicle “Serenity” (2019) are recent examples of this emerging genre. So “Free Guy” has some interesting predecessors. In this film, Ryan Reynolds’ Guy (see what they did there?!) discovers that he is an NPC, a non-player character in a video game. He’s a totally disposable automated character uninhabited by a person from the real world, mere window dressing when players enter the game to rob banks, shoot people and engage in an endless variety of senseless, violent mayhem. But Guy also houses an advanced form of artificial intelligence. When he meets Millie/Molotov Girl (“Killing Eve” star Jodie Comer), he is immediately infatuated and experiences, wait for it, feelings he’s never had before. Tragically wholesome rom-com moments ensue. In less capable hands, this story line could have sunk the audience into a sugar-induced coma or devolved into a mind-numbing Ted Talk about “big ideas.” Fortunately, Director Shawn Levy (“Night at the Museum” series, “Cheaper by the Dozen,” “Family Trap”) and his screenwriters are too skillful to let that happen. While addressing important concepts like freedom vs. determinism (sorry, we are now legally compelled to say “personal agency”), the nature of love and the value of friendship, he centers this story on more accessible themes like kindness and generosity. The offhanded violence committed incessantly against the NPCs is a conversation for another day. (“Westworld” anyone?) The cast here is first-rate. Ryan Reynolds is at his charismatic, self-effacing best because he doesn’t have to rely on superhero costumes crafted by Rubbermaid or gratuitous f-bombs (that’s right, “Deadpool”). Jodie Comer is in excellent form, having apparently perfected a unique combination of wide-eyed wonder and world weariness. Taika Waititi reprises the role of manic, bumbling villain he perfected in “Jojo Rabbit.” The film is crammed with cameos by gamers and streamers (Pokimane, LazerBeam, et al). There’s a welcome Channing Tatum sighting. There’s even a brief scene with Alex Trebek and contestants on “Jeopardy.” There are off-screen voiceovers by Dwayne Johnson, Tina Fey, Hugh Jackman and John Krasinski. But it’s the strength of Reynolds and Comer and the chemistry they build that keep this project from sinking into mediocrity. Other elements that make this film worthwhile are its brief vignettes and priceless one-liners. One such interchange occurs when Bombshell (Camille Kostek, 2019 SI Swimsuit cover model, real-life girlfriend of football player Rob Gronkowski) enters a bank on the arm of one of the robbers. After Guy dispatches the robbers, he suggests that Bombshell should be free to make her own life choices. Bombshell responds that she may not need a man at all. If only life imitated … A few of the funniest lines: Describing his coffee, Guy says, “It’s like my tongue had a baby with a sunrise.” Later, “Ooh, cappuccino. I enjoy saying that. It’s like a waterfall with letters.” After his first kiss with Millie: “I may not be real, but for a second there, I felt pretty alive.” While “Free Guy” is unlikely to make us forget “Citizen Kane” any time soon, it’s better than the standard summer fare, especially in this year’s movie wasteland littered with an overabundance of superheroes and cartoon characters. This film is breezy, funny and occasionally thought-provoking. But most of all, in an increasingly unkind world, it’s a pleasant reminder that thoughtfulness, decency and kindness are their own forms of universal truth. If you can imagine a mash-up of “Ted Lasso” and “Grand Theft Auto,” you have a sense of what this film delivers in full.",POSITIVE

Now, since THE FIRST PURGE, it's basically the same boring experience. The only nice thing about this was the purge being extended after the twelve hours. Still, wasn't able to carry the movie into a great spot - most characters were expressionles. Sad to see a great horror franchise going donwhill, especially on the last movie.",NEGATIVE

Am I somehow supposed to be impressed with this johnny come later effort from the MCU? To little and to late. Oh and being limited to the current boxed in fourth wave MCU writing tropes does not help Shang-Chi one bit. Shame Shang Chi wasn't a first, second or even third wave MCU movie script.

Scenes written in cliches wasted opportunities to deliver these characters' stories with the specificity and power they deserved. What a disappointment, seeing this particular story manage to drag! Editing would have helped, but the script was too by-the-numbers to salvage this waste of such fine acting and (of course) material. (It even managed to muddy the waters re: our understanding of the terms re: ""worth"" that were eventually left to one scene, a good one but it couldn't clarify more than one aspect.)",NEGATIVE
235,"The movie has delighted me a lot, regardless of whether I am 18 years old. I saw it together with my nephew who is a fan of the series. In itself, I really liked the realism of the characters and a new plot. Besides that here in Mexico, the voice actors of the series returned and give voice to the characters in the film. It is enjoyable and very entertaining. I hope a sequel to this one where they put the other characters in the series and be more interesting.",POSITIVE
236,"This movie was amazing! I highly recommend everybody watch this as it is imo the best mcu movie yet. Also the fact that they brought Ben Kingsley back was great as well. While the 2nd half didn't have as much martial arts action, the fights were still good. Wenwu was an amazing villain as you can really feel how much he wants to see his wife back and sort of sympathize with him. Awkwafina was also really good in this movie as she is in most movies she is in. The action and drama were all top notch and so were the characters. All of the main cast members were good and overall nothing in the movie was bad. They also played Hotel California a couple of time so that's a plus lol.",POSITIVE
237,"This movie is a must watch, it has all of the things that a purge movie needs, blood, violence, and a few new ways of killing people. Great movie",POSITIVE
238,"It has well choreographed fights, lovable characters and a good story garnered with humor. Also it corrects one of the mayor disappointments from a previous movie with a satisfying explanation and turns it into a strength. Lets start at the beginning. Since Marvel phase 4 started you hear a lot of people say that the movies are in or will decline. This movie is the counter argument. It is refreshing, entertaining and introduces new characters I want to see more of. It was also the kind of martial arts movie my friends and I missed in recent years. The story starts with a flashback thousand (or thousands?) years ago where Wenwu finds the ten rings which gave him eternal youth and so much power that he can be considered to be a god among humans. He creates the ten rings organization and becomes a really powerful ruler but operates mostly in the shadows. However his hunger for power is never satisfied. After he hears the legend of the hidden village Ta Lo where the inhabitants have mystical power he is determined to acquire this power for himself. However he will get something different and far more precious than he could have imagined. In the present Shaun works with his best friend Kathy as car valets when their lives are changed forever. I stop here with the story set up to avoid spoilers. The story itself is extremely good for an introduction movie. It gets the small and big things right. Main key elements are family, heritage, loss, finding your way or purpose in life and dealing with the past. They manage to mix the story with the characters in a way that one enhance the other. Lets continue with the characters: Simu Liu as Shaun is a great main actor. He delivers every aspect of his character and should be praised. Then we have Awkwafina as Kathy who steals the show in many scenes and is jut amazingly good. Those two together are a force to be recognized. Tony Leug is a legendary actor and his performance as Xu Wenwu is excellent. This is also valid for Michelle Yeoh. Ben Kingsley is the hidden gem of the movie and so enjoyable. Meng’er Zhang as Xu Xialing and Fala Chen as Ying Li deliver a good performance and won us easily over. Special praise to the right hand men Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon and Florian Munteanu as Razor Fist. I almost forgot Benedict Wong. Small screentime but amazing performance. The cast is fantastic and I wont replace anyone. The fights are amazing too. The first one alone should win you over with ease. The choreography is excellent and the camera works well to enhanced it while avoiding all the mistakes other movies make. Many modern movies fail with shaky camera, poor zooming (to close, bad angles, to far away or bad lighting) and uninspired ideas. Here they shine in many fights. The special effects are excellent as required per Marvel standard. Was and is never and issue. The sets and practical effects look beautiful and create an immersive atmosphere. Lastly I want to praise the humor. There are a lot of good scenes and especially a post credit scene is a must watch. Overall this was much better than expected and I heard good things about the movie before watching it. It slightly misses a 10/10 for me but is definitely a must see.",POSITIVE
239,I love Sparks but this is literally the worst movie I've ever seen and it's not even close.,NEGATIVE
240,"Let me say right off the bat that I'm neither a fan of crime caper films nor of Soderbergh. I just came for the cast and they all delivered, with Cheadle, Del Toro and Harbour as the real standouts. As for the story itself, I wasn't ready for it to escalate that quickly and to develop into something extremely convoluted about corporate greed with historical subtext as it does, even with the archival Detroit photos flashing intermittently as Don Cheadle's character, Curt, walks during the opening credits. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that the movie lost me about halfway through. Still, I genuinely admired the 70s look the film has about it, which can be most notable in the wide-angle, panoramic shots with mild barrel lens distortion (intentionally mimicking a by-product of wide-angle shooting in the early 70s, causing a distortion in the corners of the lens) in addition to the retro credits with the funky font and music. No Sudden Move is also immersed in film-noir flair, with a surfeit of low-angle and Dutch-angle shots, emphasizing power and vulnerability, and conveying a sense of tension, respectively. By the way, there is a fair amount of tense moments in the movie, some are competently gradually built-up for and others come in in a sudden influx. Wish I got much more out of this film, though.",POSITIVE
241,"TL:DR it is good, but... A film can be a lot of things, this film took on that idea. its an origin, a world franchise builder, its about redemption and finding new beginnings. the characters have multiple objectives and are not trusting of each other. GI Joe has always been about covert tactics, espionage and saving the world. I feel this film accomplished that while changing the original story to a more suitably modern take while not wasting anyone's time. the movie can't please everyone, old gi joe fans want the original snake eyes, others don't want white washing of a character that ""could"" be from Asia, some hate how sloppy the fights and spectacles are cut, others hate the narrative because it didn't do such and such. it a pg-13 movie based on a series of children's action figures and it should be taken for what it is, not for what it isn't. to finish this review, I liked all of the characters and thought the performances were spectacular. I liked the campiness humor thrown in to some of the fights and training. the stunts and slow motion in the fight scenes were also very cool and despite some close cuts, it didn't hinder the actions on display or the story. I think the future of the GI Joe movie franchise is looking brighter than it ever has and in the end, what every fan wants is more content.",POSITIVE
242,"Pig is not what it seems to be at first, and personally for me that unpredictable element was a pretty good thing. Firstly, because this film is definitely not John Wick with a pig, and secondly because it has a style and tone that are exchanged in a surprising way, but that never seem out of place. Not everything works in the best way, but it was an experience I enjoyed. But let's be clear, there's no action here, nor is this a revenge thriller. Forget it. I mean, the experience doesn't get boring, or at least that didn't happen for me, but I must stress it because even with certain elements of violence, Pig is a story of a man trying to regain the only thing he has left of the reclusive life he lives now. The character apparently has a past that is mentioned, although not fully explored. But this is not essential to understanding him, because after all he's simply not the man he once was. What remains of him and what is shown to us is the man who is doing everything possible to find his animal. Nicolas Cage is not on this film to remind the public that he knows how to act. Those who have seen enough movies know what he can do. It's just annoying not to see him like this more often. Because of its style, Pig is a film that must be slowly digested. It's not made with the disposition to please a mainstream audience and it doesn't try to. It doesn't compromise its vision either, and it's clearly not afraid of disappointing the audiences who will be wrong about it. It is what it is. Take it or leave it.",NEGATIVE
243,Beautifully rendered story that I didn't want to end. Its authenticity has remained with me and I look forward to future works from this director. The acting was superb as was the cinematography.,POSITIVE
244,"I'm struggling to find good things to say about this handsomely produced effort. As one critic said, it is caught between creating a character and rebooting a commercial franchise. Earlie GI Joe movies, also handsomely produced, had this problem even worse. What I can say is the casting, acting, direction and production values have commitment close the level of a Marvel movie. What makes it forgettable is its theme is, ""I will find peace thru revenge,"" the MOST TIRED TROPE OF ALL TIME; and, as critics note, the action scenes only satisfy if you are age 12 or younger.",NEGATIVE
245,"Udo Kier's work is a complete and enough attribute for you to be interested in seeing this movie, yet I must warn you that Swan Song demands patience. It's not a movie that has a good rhythm, and gets really boring at times. It's Kier who keeps it centered, it's just a shame that the script and direction weren't up to his work.",NEGATIVE
246,"If you tolerated the other Purge films then I’m sure you’ll enjoy this one. But for those of us who prefer films to have well-shot action, coherent plots, decent acting and non-preachy narratives, this is a pass.",POSITIVE
247,Absolutely stunning. A beautiful story with an amazing performance given by the entire cast. A masterpiece.,POSITIVE
248,"La pelicula es un desproposito es mala, mal guion, efectos chimbos, malas actuaciones, el personaje masculino principal lo opacan las personajes secundarias, un villano con un final mas ridiculo que su version anterior, escenas despues de creditos y personajes de cameos mal usados e irreconocibles, peleas cortas y flashback sin sentido que no aportan a la historia y si es aburrida",NEGATIVE
249,Shang chi is a visual masterpiece with engaging and impactful storyline. This is the best introduction a Marvel superhero could ever have.,POSITIVE
250,"Don Cheadle and Benicio del Toro play 2 low-level criminal types in 50’s Detroit. They’re assigned to retrieve a document, but as expected, things go in mis-directions. This cast is nimble with the performances and director Steven Soderberg keeps things compelling with a bit of low level tension. Even so, the details of the plot are sometimes muddled. Soderberg chose to use extreme wide angle lenses for his period look, but the distortion can be distracting. Don’t mistake this for a typical gangster flick. This film is about interactions, not violence. It’s obvious that an accomplished artist put this together, because it’s absorbing, even when the payoff isn’t especially gratifying. BTW, Brendan Fraser has dramatically gained weight because he’s ramping up to star as a 600lb recluse in THE WHALE by Darren Aronofsky. Also, Matt Damon has an uncredited role.",POSITIVE
251,It is a literal mess. Wtf is this film about anyway? Do not waste your money to support creation of such miserable movies.,NEGATIVE
252,"Utterly disappointing movie: production value was clearly high, but the script is just terribly written. Scenario is in the same cheezy, over-the-top (in a bad way) veins as the worst Luc Besson movies (not surprising at all to see Lucy among the director's past works) or David Cage videogames.",NEGATIVE
253,"A somewhat exasperating drama that stands out more for the well-done work of its two protagonists than for the merits of the narration. It may lend itself to a cliché-drenched dynamic, but there's authenticity in the emotions both present. Which makes up for the flat narrative structure.",POSITIVE
254,"Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins is a fun action packed adventure story that keeps you entertained from start to finish. Henry Golding makes this film feel more human, more emotional and more heroic than any other Snake Eyes adaptation on the big screen. With more humor, more character development, and more ninja action than the previous G.I. Joe films, this is easily the best G.I. Joe flick yet!",POSITIVE
255,"Free Guy is the modern version of the movies your parents love, very predictible and funny but not much.",NEGATIVE

257,"Marvel Studios’ “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” is the latest modern-day extension to the MCU? Guided to craft beautifully by Destin Daniel Cretton. Shang-Chi has a massive soulfulness that future MCU movies need to take notes on and that only Black Panther did so memorably. It occurred to me while watching this movie that it is genuinely no longer about the characters we focus on, but it is their adventure toward locating themselves, and we follow that adventure here in an amazing Superhero Oriental Fantasy blockbuster. Noticeably, the VFX, scene sets, costume designs, and the special effects themselves incredibly heightened the impact of the movie and allowed a symbolic impact on the awe-inspiring production value and, as a result, the aforementioned movie knocked out in dazzling heights on a beautiful scale because of the VFX. The movement sequences and choreography are polished and stunning. Narratively, the storyline continues incredibly, and we understand the moments of humour the MCU is so well-known for, and we are all here for it. This film divided me going to the cinema and waiting for a digital component! Because of COVID-19, however, I didn’t need to have the entirety of Shang-Chi spoiled earlier on with leaks, thank goodness I went to the very first showing on the opening Thursday night, I have experienced Shang-Chi several times now and in extraordinarily different formats including 4D-X. This movie displays some of the most remarkably phenomenal combat performances in a Marvel movie I had never seen in this noticeable approach previously. The movie is formulaic and well-trodden territory for Marvel and has several exceptional visual effects layered in. Shang-Chi is such an enchanting movie to watch and even better on the biggest screen you can find, keeping safety in mind at all times! If you have seen Marvel movies consistently, you’ve got to know that the narrative is a predictable storyline for Marvel’s superhero foundation adventures. This film is full of numerous great moments, with its battle sequences and action set pieces, which is arguably undoubtedly its major attraction. But Shang-Chi has given us some outstanding personalities and characters in a live-action film like Black Panther’s did so on his solitary quest. Marvel Studios’ Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the most exceptional superhero movies I’ve watched in years, if not in the past decade. Simu Liu and Meng’er Zhang and Tony Leung Chiu Wai get considerable distinct and exceptional choreographed action choreography that we have not witnessed since Captain America: Winter Soldier. There is not any one thing like Shang-Chi I have seen before in the MCU, this film seems fresh. Shang-Chi feeds us with the deprived traditional antique sequences of martial craftsmanship, which we appreciate a lot as an audience and applauds in an incredible modern depiction. This is one of the better, exceptional Marvel films ever. I would recommend watching this one.",POSITIVE
258,"Easily one of the best music documentaries of all time. It's better than ""WattStax,"" which came out in 1973. And it's more culturally relevant than ""Woodstock."" It's about a moment in time when America was coming to the realization that change was inevitable.",POSITIVE
259,"Easily the worst in the whole series. Plot is all over the place and hardly makes sense. I don't expect these movies to be ""realistic"" anymore, but some of the scenes in this film are just so over the top that it's just bad. One of the few redeeming parts of the movie is that it has quite a few callbacks to earlier movies and some tongue in cheek references to the characters ability to survive anything. All in all I didn't really think it was worth the watch and I think Justin Lin has lost his touch and needs to leave it to others.",NEGATIVE
260,Ok so the movie isn't great and it isn't terrible. If you wanna shut off your brain then go to this movie. Action is good enough and the CGI is pretty cool. But idk man just an popcorn movie,POSITIVE
261,The action was amazing it was not like the same old marvel movie the acting was perfect and I laughed watching it good movie,POSITIVE
262,Infectiously warm introduction (for many) and tribute to a duo who’s been right here all along. Its hard not to be won over by both the music and the filmmaking. The film should serve its purpose of generating new fans while Ron and Russell are still with us. We loved it.,POSITIVE
263,"When telling the life story of an iconic and complicated figure like Aretha Franklin, it can be difficult to get everything right. Decisions regarding what should and shouldn't be included can be fraught with difficult choices, some of which will undoubtedly disappoint while others will be perfectly spot-on. Considerations like these almost assuredly had to have gone into the process of devising the narrative and screenplay for the biopic of this storied entertainer and activist, the result of which has drawn decidedly mixed reactions. For my money, however, director Liesl Tommy's debut feature mostly gets it right, especially in the outstanding Oscar-worthy lead performance of Jennifer Hudson, the supporting portrayal of Skye Dakota Turner as Aretha's younger self and the musical numbers, all of which are absolute knock-outs. Admittedly the film is somewhat formulaic (some might say predictable or even trite in certain sequences) and a bit overlong in its attempt to capture as much of Ms. Franklin's life story as possible. Nevertheless, in the greater scheme of things, ""Respect"" is a capably made, exceedingly entertaining offering that's far from deserving of most of the petty sniping that's been directed its way. Doing justice to the Queen of Soul is a daunting prospect, to be sure, but I find it difficult to believe that she would be disappointed by the results.",POSITIVE
264,super funny all the way through the entire movie. you will see lots of familiar faces and even some of the best youtubers and streamers. there are lots of game references and movie references. i absolutely loved it and would recommend going to see it.,POSITIVE
265,"Un mélange de John Wick et de Nikita pour cette production américaine sous la direction d’un réalisateur français dont l’action se déroule au Japon… mais à dire vrai, on a surtout l’impression de regarder l’un de ces nanars avec Jason Statham sauf que c’est la jolie Mary Elizabeth Winstead qui s’y colle. Jolie à regarder certes mais athlétique et aussi mortelle qu’elle peut l’être, cette assassine professionelle ! car Kate Nikita Wick n’amuse certainement pas le terrain et aligne les macabés comme à la parade. L’actrice lui donne néanmoins une certaine épaisseur entre quelques dézinguages de vilains yakuzas : elle est bien plus convaincante qu’un Statham, cela va sans dire. Une pisseuse otacul bling-bling en vient à l’accompagner lors de son périple de vengeance furieuse alors qu’elle tente de retrouver le salopard qui l’a empoisonnée… L’ambiance survoltée du Tokyo nocturne se prête bien sûr fort bien à moult bastons et fusillades mais hélas, contrairement à un John Wick (ou même notre fameux ‘Nikita’ national) l’action reste un peu trop mal filmée pour convaincre : trop de zooms et de cuts malmènent les efforts de Miss Winstead. En outre, le scénar sent le nanar à des kilomètres et le fil blanc de ses coutures qui craquent rapidement se voit comme le nez au milieu de la figure. Heureusement que le rythme ne faiblit pas ou si peu, sinon on aurait commencé à pester, voire s’ennuyer un brin… mais c’est tout à fait regardable en définitive.",NEGATIVE
266,"This film was horrible, for a horror movie in general and also in comparison to Peele's previous work. Also odd that he chooses to use his platform to choose to murder all the white people in the movie. Plus has a complete misunderstanding of gentrification, as again, he tried to push that agenda in the film as well.",NEGATIVE
267,Laughably bad futuristic noir with Hugh Jackman wading through a flooded Miami and a muddled script to deliver one of the biggest turkeys of the year - 1 star for the bizarre sex scene involving Hugh splaying himself out on a chair in a wacky tribute to Flashdance.,NEGATIVE
268,"I am too old for this sh*t - that's what most of the cast members should have said when FF9 was pitched for the first time. This time the over the top car-action was not enough to save this movie. New characters that were written into the story from scratch without actually adding anything, the well-known characters who continuously try to maintain an emotional sentiment with the looks they give each other and jokes that were fun in previous parts are now ‘cheezy’ at best. Despite the fact that the film itself is still nice to watch for free on tv, it has all become very ridiculous and even more unrealistic. This franchise seems to be a victim of their own urge to keep going despite all the signals that it's been a closed book for a long time.",NEGATIVE
269,"When You Think The Rough Draft Is Good Enough.... Rushed is a film that is the rough draft of what could have possibly been, had this film had competent professionals who could recognize this is not a finished product - just a half-baked lasagna that needs more time. Siobhan Fallon Hogan, who has proven to be a master in her class as an accomplished actress, seems to have not much industry support for this project that she wrote and produced(with the assistance of her family and Robert Patrick). I would really like the Hogan family and their Emerald Caz Productions to take Rushed and flesh it out into a Lifetime series, or go more adult and darker with other streaming sources, and turn this project into a platform that truly exposes the subject matter. A Rushed series would allow Siobhan Fallon Hogan to expound much more deeply her writing and allow the Hogans(and Robert Patrick) more opportunity to fine tune their production skills, so that other Emerald Caz Productions project can feel more polished and defined.",NEGATIVE
270,"Welcome to part XII of ""is M. Night Shyamalan in on the joke or is he being for real this time?"" Weirdness is most assuredly a part of M. Night Shyamalan's style. Even his best films can't seem to escape that one stray line or awkward beat that leaves the audience scratching their heads. At its worst, the weirdness can tank the film (i.e. ""The Happening""), but ever since ""The Visit,"" however, the above question has entered into the picture with considerable intensity. Is it something he can just turn on and off or is he really being genuine 100% of the time? I have half a mind to believe it's not even a question anymore with ""Old."" Even in ""The Happening,"" yeah, the overall feel is off, but the ratio of awkwardness is much more subdued, feeling more like an honest-to-God attempt at something higher than it really is. Here, the wackiness is so off-the-wall and rapid fire that I gotta believe there's been a concerted effort to voluntarily mug at the camera, so to speak. In any event, the result is far from boring, wholeheartedly preposterous and an unmitigated brow-furrower. Please bubblewrap M. Night Shyamalan. We need to keep him safe so he can keep making silly **** like this until the end of time. If he does have a genuinely good movie in there somewhere, though, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to see that too. Here's hoping he doesn't think this is one of those.",POSITIVE
271,Matt Damon is amazing. Its good to see him back in the drama genre he does it so well!. Really enjoyed the movie.,POSITIVE
272,"Went to see this with my dad who likes the films as a father's day gift (I haven't watched any of the films), but my god is this film dumb. Most of the time it's fun dumb, but it does go normal dumb. Fair warning, a lot of the dialogue is genuinely cringeworthy and the main villain's backstory is so dumb, it makes a kid's show villain look good. Also, if you saw this in IMAX, you got a preview of Jurassic World Dominion, which was neat.",POSITIVE

275,"I heard a lot of chatter about Malignant being some kind of neo-Giallo film, but I really think that was just an attempt to distract from the true nature of this film, to protect the twist in the third act. Sure there are elements of Giallo here but they are just nods. The true parentage of Malignant is over-the-top violent, frenetic paced and usually at least SEMI tongue-in-cheek horror B movies from the 70's and 80's. James Wan sets the viewer up for the ride in the opening sequence with an absolutely bonkers set piece that lets you know his intentions right off the bat. It's gonna be bloody, violent and poke fun at it's own parentage. I truly believe that this is done as a way to communicate to the viewer - ""Stay with us on this ride. It's going somewhere great. The 2nd act will drag a little but there is a good reason."" Once you see the reveal, you understand a lot of the more puzzling elements earlier on. Now, is this film an acting class? Nope. It is the most clever plot you'll ever see? Not even. Will you guess the twist early on? That depends on how many of these types of films you have seen before. I figured out what sub-genre this was early on but I didn't get the twist until about five seconds before it dropped in all it's glory. I only had time to get out ""NO WAY."" before my wife said ""What?"" and then we were both like - ""WT actual F?!?!"" I just have to applaud James Wan for attempting something fresh and semi-original here. There is so much to like about this film. The cinematography, most of the special effects, the humor, the way it doesn't pull punches with the violence - and the fact that there is no gratuitous sexuality. This film is on a mission. If you relax, have fun with it and don't take it (or yourself) too seriously, this film is a blast and a joy to behold, for fans of bloody disgusting horror, anyway. If you don't like violence, DO NOT watch this film. There are no jump scares and no silly Deus-Ex-Machina resolutions. In the end it all makes glorious, ridiculous, bloody, violent sense. If you dig movies like My Bloody Valentine, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, Basket Case, Dead Ringers, Sinister, etc... you will most likely be grinning like an idiot at the end of Malignant. Invite some friends over, order a pizza and have a blast with this one. It's definitely worth checking out.",POSITIVE
276,"It's impressive for a debut feature film, but like many first efforts, it's not perfect. It's writing possesses an uneven storyline and an inconsistent tone, although the themes of death and loss are well-explored. The triumph in 'Pig' however, is the acting. Nicolas Cage puts on what is probably his best performance since 'Adaptation."" He perfectly captures the loss and determination underneath a character clinging onto his sole true companion, even if it is simply a pig. The movie as a whole left a lot to be desired, certainly with areas for improvement, but even with its sometime slow pacing, the realistic acting keeps from becoming just a weird, overreaching melodrama.",POSITIVE
277,Such a fun movie to watch with family! Laughed a lot and had an overall great time! The rock is HILARIOUS,POSITIVE

279,By far the worst movie I've watched in my life. Movies are for entertainment and spoiler alert: nothing happens in this movie. Literally nothing.,NEGATIVE
280,"Cannot rave about this movie enough. Our entire family was pleasantly surprised, we were completely drawn in within 15 minutes and were hooked the entire time! A complete feel good and unique movie with warm hearted comical charm by Ryan Reynolds.",POSITIVE
281,"After quite a wait, RESPECT came out and was an enjoyable film for the most part. Jennifer Hudson hit a home run at every turn in this film and truly took my breath away multiple times, sending shivers down my spine with how wonderful her voice was (I mean what else could we expect from one of the best voices of our time)! The film touched on some very impactful moments of Aretha's life, which is to be expected in a biopic. However, it did seem to fail in the area of her relationship with her children. It portrayed Aretha as perhaps one of the worst parental figures of our time basically having the children just on the outskirts of the film the entire time. You never really see her spend time with them except for a few scenes and in the rest they're background characters and rarely alluded to or mentioned. It was a big misstep as far as direction goes. Children shouldn't be counted out as major plot points of a biopic ever. The remainder of the cast did a pretty great job with the film as well. I was glad that they took some sensitive early moments and portrayed them the way they did instead of using a graphic depiction. It was, to me, more impactful this way. Overall, I'd say the film did a great job, but definitely had some misses and opportunities to be better. Some portions of her life they seemed to dwell on at times and it would last much too long, when other moments that may have seemed very important were dealt with much quicker and could have been longer instead of others in the film. I look forward to having this film at home, but it is certainly one that needs to be seen in the theater sheerly for the sound design. The music all felt live and really utilized the surround sound technology to encompass the audience completely in a wonderful experience.",POSITIVE
282,Great humor and action. The dad jokes are the best part of the movie though!,POSITIVE
283,"It is a heartfelt family movie. But at the same time it is so generic and calculated in its approach. The whole music career thing has been done in hundreds of other teen comedies and dramas. The new thing here is that it is used as a metaphor for any decision people make and are misunderstood by their loved ones. Ruby's family can't here her voice so literally they don't know what's her passion is all about. It is touching at times, but also almost too sweet and cheesy. The audition to Berklee College is such an emotionally manipulative fake scene. I don't know why people praise this movie so much. It is an OK film. Is it about inclusion of deaf actors in the production? Yes, they were great, but if we want to be honest and equal - this kind of storytelling in a different movie would make everybody roll their eyes and describe it as a Hallmark movie.",POSITIVE
284,"I have never been so angry. Candyman is my favorite horror movie. This film is not Candyman. It is political propaganda to show that police officers are evil. The climax of the film tried to make the murder of officers justified, which is wrong whether they are guilty or not. It was a gross misrepresentation of officers, trying to make it seem like they are all bad. The message was showing that the current narrative is that officers are innocent, when in reality officers always get the short end of the stick. The media’s message is ALWAYS that the officer is in the wrong, whether they are or not. Candyman’s final words were to tell everyone, so I did. DO NOT give your money to this movie! Do not allow hollywood to spread this propaganda!",NEGATIVE
285,"Most pathetic adventure once could experience?!The starting plot was a bit suspenseful, but within minutes you will realize that the director of the film was struggling to keep up with the suspense. Screenwriters have really tried hard to include some punch lines and stupid comedies, but as of today's film standards those comedies are far outdated and frankly speaking shouldn't be even considered funny by children. It wasn't an adventure movie at all by far as the name suggests, moreover just running the scripts to end the film. I suppose Disney have lost the charm. Total waste of 2 hours and the money that was spent for creating this pathetic cruise. Would recommend just to watch it once and never think about it again.",NEGATIVE
286,It's a awesome movie worth watching full of action suspense and thriller. This is absolutely a full entertainment pumpup package,POSITIVE
287,"It's a good movie . James Wan is awesome . Not only the horror, the fight sequences are also good .",POSITIVE
288,A very moving film that brought humanity back to the art of film. The film allowed us to see how deeply the characters loved and grieved. Loved the cinematography and the music. Best performance by Mr. Cage. I watched it until the credits stopped and I intend to see it again.,POSITIVE
289,"It's unapologetically dumb, and I'm quite capable of appreciating a movie that isn't afraid to embrace the complete absurdity, but Free Guy is a movie lacking in tone and direction. What this film tries to do for its entire duration is to seek to throw as much as it can on the screen in order to make you believe that it's very funny, when in fact it's just repeating itself. This occurs because after certain situations, pretty much after the first twenty minutes of the story, its arsenal of gags begins to run out severely, so the film begins to fill in the gaps with real-life reactions of some gamers, and news coverage so they can explain you that the character is simply doing something out of the ordinary. As if you weren't already seeing it with your own eyes. Free Guy is a high-concept idea executed with a defeatist mindset. Why do I say this? Very simple. Its creators and lead actor expect you to be satisfied with just the visuals, so you can forget about the rest. And it's not that I've tried to find some kind of narrative depth in this film, I'd be fooling myself, but it's a little hard to avoid thinking about it when the lead character, despite his eternal smile, is basically having an existential crisis. Free Guy is just entertainment. Dumb entertainment, but its ambitions are conscious enough to die there, but it's entertainment that becomes hollow after a while, which is ironic considering the story takes place in an open-world video game, and those games need a huge amount of variants to not bore the player. The presence of Ryan Reynolds playing himself for the umpteenth time, stopped being enough for me quite a while ago.",NEGATIVE
290,"From the masterminds behind HBO's Westworld comes this sad return to the action genre for Hugh Jackman. The mix that it was presenting, sounded pretty good and looked pretty good, but the mystery conjured up in this tale is actually really poor and mostly unattractive. I'll be honest, halfway through, I really stopped caring what the hell happened to Rebecca Ferguson's character, and it turned out even worse when it revealed how terribly simplistic her fate was. Reminiscence has all the structure and semblance of being a great science fiction blockbuster, even with its relatively modest budget, and if you only look at the facade. However in a cruel joke with its title, it's reminiscent of many other films, and ultimately the puzzle it asks us to put together is just very simplistic. And the intrigue delivered isn't enough to want to go all the way until the end. But hey, we got to see Hugh Jackman for the second time acting completely infatuated by seeing Rebecca Ferguson singing.",NEGATIVE
291,I Feel this movie can be a new Launch pad for Nicolas Cage. He's really talented.Independent movies like this are respectable for me.Because they are facing with so many challenges.,POSITIVE
292,"1. Stillwater reminds me of The Edge of Heaven(2007).They seem to have extended the final third of The Edge of Heaven for 140 minutes! 2. In Stillwater there are two presuppositions of the story. The first half of the film is about one of them and the second half is about the other. This makes the ending of the film emotionally confusing. ""Savior Father"" and ""Man in a New Life"" could have overlapped, but now the film is fragmented.",NEGATIVE

294,"PIG has a great story. One about human's lost and how each deal with it differently. For once, this is a story that talk about men's emotions and how subdue they are. Nicolas Cage is simply put, perfect and credible. He transport that movie with it's hidden charisma. The filming is simple with some nice shots. The music fits very wells. I give it 82%. I have nothing bad to say about the movie. I don't think it's perfect but a great acting performance and story are worth watching.",POSITIVE
295,"Let me start by saying how fun this movie is. It is really IS fun. Does not mean it's perfect. In fact, it breaks logic of the premise several times. Love story is cliche, pacing is not well either. But most jokes land, an average gamer would know almost all references here. This is movie for us, but then for non-gamer people this would not work (for example Ready Player One did work and people like my old parents understood it at least and could follow). The ""YouTubers and streamers"" part was nice but in my opinion was a bit too much, just show once, we are not here for Ninja's commentary on the movie. By far the best cameos are towards the end. And ""final boss"" scene was the most fun too. 3.5/5 is fair I think. And I feel it would be enjoyable as well on second viewing later.",POSITIVE
296,I went in not expecting much with the mixed reviews but it's not as bad as others have let on. It's very watchable if a little campy but it's Disney so that's to be expected. If you're going in expecting deep story and gritty realism you're in the wrong place to begin with. If you just want a fun escape and some campy adventure this is worth the watch. Kids might not get many of the jokes though. Will I watch it again? Probably not as once you've been on the ride once you've experienced all you're going to get out of it. The acting was fine but nothing memorable you'll want to live again and again.,POSITIVE
297,If you tolerated the other Purge films then I’m sure you’ll enjoy this one.,POSITIVE
298,"F9 is about Dom is leading to get off the grid with Letty and his son but then Roman comes to show something coming up and when Letty leaves he looks at it again and zoomed in to see who took out NoBody and the sins of his past comes at him while the crew has to help him with Dom's brother Jacob F9 surprised me I love when Fast & Furious does a story's in this movie has that so the pass scenes with Don's brother and his dad are great and it is sad also I thought I was going to have a problem of han's character and I did not it made sense how it happened and he was scared not to show himself which he did when Letty was in trouble worked so well I was surprised that the storytelling was not messy like other films I watched Jacob as the main villian is great I thought I was not going to believe him as a villian does great as a villian about his dad and his brother and his team betrays him and he is battling his own team so when he is about to fall Mia saves him the one thing i am confused about is Cipher is she used a other drone to take out Dom what!!!!!!!!!

302,Passed the time but wouldn’t recommend it to others. The main male star wasn’t likable or relatable enough. The female star was great. But overall I wouldn’t recommend,NEGATIVE
303,This movie was incredible and Jennifer Hudson nailed it as Aretha Franklin something Cynthia Ervio couldn't do at all. It is a must see because this was done with Respect and with Aretha knowing about it and not waiting for Aretha to die and disrespect her wishes by doing something behind her back and excluding her family from the process.,POSITIVE
304,"Udo Kier has had a long and interesting career and this is yet another unique role. He plays a retired hairdresser who has settled into the relative obscurity and loneliness of a nursing home. After the death of a local society woman (Linda Evans), he’s hired to do her hair, which involves him returning to scrutinize what’s left of his former glory. Of course, the character is flamboyant, but with Kier, he’s a more subdued flamer. There are moments of introspection and bits of lost relationships, but none is especially touching. As a result, there are too many moments of sad staring that drag down the pace. Even Jennifer Coolidge lacks much punch in her supporting role. While there was potential for this to be a wildly fun look at a colorful character, writer/director Todd Stephens hasn’t elevated this project with his rather Earth-bound approach.",NEGATIVE
305,Holy baby Jesus and a can of beans this movie was actually really good.M.Night Shamababam did it again and showed us a pretty interesting concept made into a movie. I would've enjoyed it more if there was more backstory in regards to the characters that participated and I kinda disliked the fact that some of them were killed pretty fast and actually kinda stupidly. The acting was pretty great for the most part especially the kids actors.The effects were also pretty good and I wanna give a huge thumbs up for the makeup artists which probably did the biggest job of everyone in the movie since there were constant subtle changes in the characters in every scene. Ending was pretty great kinda reminded me of an entire SCP foundation story which is a big bonus for me since I love that ****,POSITIVE
306,"All I can say is we laughed a lot! It is hilarious and ridiculous. It goes off the rails in so many ways. A family on vacation at an island resort is invited to spend the day at a secluded beach. They are dropped off and told to walk through the jungle to a canyon and go through that. Arriving on the beach, they are enchanted by its secluded beauty. Shortly thereafter, the train to crazy town leaves the station.",POSITIVE
307,"I watched this movie, not by choice, with very low expectations because of other reviews. I found it to be far far worse. The cast, the only highlight, managed the best they could with the a poor script and terrible direction from Jaume Collet-Serra. I suppose Disney spent all of its budget on cast and CG with nothing left for an experienced director of effects heavy summer blockbusters. Warner Bros. needs to rethink 'Black Adam' in a hurry. The characters are uniformly unlikable for the first third of the film and weirdly inconsistent in motivations throughout. The story is okay, but predictable. You'll probably see a lot of things coming ahead of time. Generally, the movie seems scripted for kids, but scary moments and some extreme violence are definitely meant for adults. Action scenes, the main reason people will watch this movie, are badly edited. The beginning or end of some action beats are over-trimmed or from poor camera angles. They leave you scratching your head over what just happened. Considering the rest of the film, it's quite possible the director failed to shoot enough coverage for which the editor to work. The soundtrack is awful and frequently as inappropriate as the score to 'Ladyhawke'. Effects and CGI work are a mixed bag. Some is so good, you won't even notice it. Some is a rip-off of ""Dead Man's Chest"" and will take you out of the moment when you realize it. The worst is the CG animals, which are shockingly poor and look like they came from a 10 year old video game. Ridiculously jarring is the modern idioms. They are out of place in 1916 and even further out of place in the Amazon basin of 1916. I won't mention the stuffed in modern politics that don't serve any purpose to the plot or story, but it's 2020's Disney, so you probably already expect it. Of course there are the 'Jungle Cruise' style jokes. Did I say style? Nope, many of the jokes are ripped right from the ride. So, if they were groaners before, they're painful now. Finally, many better movies were shamelessly ripped off. ""African Queen"", which the Disneyland ride was based on, makes up a big chunk of the style and period. The beginning is largely ""Atlantis the Lost Empire"". Brendan Fraser's ""Mummy"" is robbed for theming, characters and a ladder gag. Sean Connery's ""Medicine Man"" is plundered for specifics of the Amazon and plot MacGuffin. Some backstory is taken from ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"", with monster design ripped straight from ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"". Gags were stolen from ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" and ""Despicable Me"". Also copied is a tree from ""Avatar"". There is nothing original. I recommend watching any or all of those movies instead. There was a time Disney would have hit this out of the park (pardon the pun). Disney is no longer that studio. There is little good or entertaining. Do not waste your time. Do not waste your money.",NEGATIVE
308,Not a popcorn movie. Hard pass if you have anything else waiting for you in your movie queue. Cheesy action movies are my guilty LOVE but this movie doesn't deliver on the action... or being a movie. Characters have no relatable goals making incoherent choices. Hyper-cut action with no consequences and a story so disjointed it felt written by Gumby. Personal thoughts: These are some of the most capable action actors and you hyper cut their fights. All you had to do is give us clean action and we'd forgive race swapping Snake Eyes and reimagining the most beloved GI Joe character. Truly disappointed.,NEGATIVE

Their on-screen chemistry is brilliant, and they display their individual passions clearly and credibly. There's a sweet love story here. The villain of the movie hearkens back to the moustache-twirling days of yore, with a ruthlessly driven mind played brilliantly by Jesse Plemons. The dialogue of the film is witty and entertaining, and remarkably sophisticated, tackling sensitive issues with taste and class. The special effects and settings are authentic and really well done. Set pieces are magnificent and breathtaking. You can almost feel the steamy heat of the Amazon in each scene. The supernatural aspect is a nice welcome twist, always. Just like the Pirates franchise, Disney really knows how to spin off classic theme park rides into excellent movies. The jungle cruise within cruise was a funny meta twist. There's a massive twist half way through the movie that absolutely nobody saw coming, which really changes the perspective on a major character. Bravo script writers. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is epic in scale, reminiscent of earlier classic adventure films. This is an excellent must watch film.",POSITIVE

I just find her so very generic in every way. I think I might have found her compelling once (Dr. Sleep?), but now she's just meh. Might be her ridiculous take on Dune (she claims the script had to be doctored for 21st century audiences because obviously any male writer from the 60s is sexist, even though she admits to not only NOT reading it, but unable to understand the few pages she did. She laughingly admits to needing her male costars to explain it to her . LMAO, she needed mansplaining, ROFL). The rest is just a bland sci-fi noire that tries to be Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? Boring romance scenes over and over. I guess there's a warning g about climate change in there. It's a dud despite Jackman's likeability and Newtins sex appeal.",NEGATIVE
316,THIS MOVIE IS SO DISAPPOINTING AND A WASTE OF POTENTIAL. The characters deliver their lines like robots and the characters are so DUMB it's funny. This movie is so bad that it is a joy to sit through because you laugh the entire time!! You don't care about anyone who dies because the characters are not developed and have no personality. The character deaths are so random and sudden so when they die you just say WTF XD. This movie should have been a bit longer and should have developed their characters to have a personality so you are shocked and care when they die. They also should have stayed at the resort for longer for world building. Also this movie is SOOO PERDICTABLE. You know the bad guy from the start. Bad Movie But Fun To Watch,NEGATIVE

323,"If it doesn't get the Razzy, it was robbed. Honestly, this movie is so insanely bad, it is good, then bad again. It can only be assumed its intentionally bad. The acting is absolutely awful. The dialogue is very canned and stilted. The actors have about as much inflection as a My Buddy Doll. Even their actions a dumb. The cops act like a bad 1970s under budget cop show. And everyone makes conclusions that aren't evident. In one scene, the lead protagonist is putting her dirty clothes in the dryer (unwashed) when she witnesses a murder. All the characters just follow along for no logical reason other than to set up the next scene. Our mid-twenties protagonist doesn't even remember her teenager traumas, without her overly bewildered mother showing her home movies that were somehow kept and forgotten up until this point. Somehow her own same-age sister doesn't even remember this. It makes no sense. Also, every character is exceedingly cliché to the point of stupidity. The intended horror scenes are so bad, that they are laughable. Seriously, you will laugh at how absurd they are. I can literally point out something wrong in every single scene. Its that overwhelmingly bad. I have seen better films on Mystery Science Theater. Troll 2 and the Room may have new competition for worst movie.",NEGATIVE
324,"Jennifer Hudson was so electrifying portraying the Queen of Soul. She entrances you into forgetting it’s her on the screen. Instead of mimicking the source, like some actors in biopics, she hammers the essence and genius of Ms. Franklin through a pivotal time in her illustrious career. Her singing these songs LIVE and not to a prerecorded track cements her performance as a contender for an Oscar. I would go as far to say she deserves the Oscar barring some monumental performance of a lidtetime.",POSITIVE

326,"Another Marvel lackluster film. Other than having an all Asian cast, which is mostly put to waste on over-americanized script, there is nothing inspiring about this film. It's as if Marvel uses a cookie cutter for its scripts with the obligatory goofy comic moments and earnest back-stories to try to please everyone. The only thing it does is make for incoherent film making. The movie had moments and perhaps if were edited down it would have made one mediocre episode in a TV series, but instead, it goes on and on for over 2hrs 15mins where it devolves as the minutes go by, ending with a silly over-the-top ending with dragons that look more like rainbow unicorn toys than anything mythical. This is NO Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon -- nor does it compare to 2017's Wonder Woman. With not much else being release - if you have nothing better to do, then sure go see it. Someone needs to talk to Marvel's VFX Supervisor. Good grief - the character animations were dreadful.",NEGATIVE

The plot is senseless and characters are not that much connecting to the audience. Like previous parts, movie's writing part is weak and they all defy basic physics, but that's kinda the fun part. This part is for the audience who love action. Movie has dumber dialogue, laugh at/with it, but don't come into it expecting a masterpiece. One problem with the movie was that it was too long. They could have easily cut 30 minutes out of it. This franchise is no more like real story with real action. It's like entertaining movie for those who love action and comedy, even if it is senseless. Overall, it's entertaining movie which you will love either if you are Fast franchise fan or if you love senseless action and comedy.",POSITIVE
332,"I had a good time watching Jungle Cruise because the thrills just keep on coming.

333,"(Mauro Lanari) Shyamalan had to stop being himself to make a decent movie. ""Nihil sub sole novum"" (Qohelet 1, 10), but at least images of accelerated decomposition resurface as not seen since the Greenaway of ""A Zed & Two Noughts"" (1985) or from the advertising launch of the Xbox in 2001-2 (""From birth to grave""). His end twist this time explains practically nothing and that's okay. The characters become progressively blurred (Allen, ""Deconstructing Harry"", 1997) and the director plays the role of the controller who with a telescope observes, himself the first spectator, what happens on the beach (Hitchcockian voyeurism). Welcome to the realm of the (so far) irreversibility of Chrόnos.",NEGATIVE
334,"Entertaining if somewhat long superhero origin story. Both leads are very entertaining and their interactions with each other and the outside world, and are a highlight of the movie.

336,"An overall great movie with amazing soundtrack, a deep story with a great villain, and breathtaking action and visuals. It has some minor flaws but nothing big you could complain about. The humor was also on point and doesn't stop the a action, like it did in some other Marvel movies.",POSITIVE
337,"Good performances from both leads, but the ambiguity around Makwa is confusing. I like that the Native American director explores unusual places in terms of representation; however, I think that his speech falls short. The 'American Psycho' approach is kind of interesting, but it feels like the story is trying to excuse Makwa à la 'Joker.'",NEGATIVE
338,"While Candyman is well-shot, well-acted, its hand-puppet scenes are very well done, and its themes of art and artistic approach are great, it disappoints as an overall picture in the end. One of the biggest issues is it truly isn't scary or intense in any way beyond the body horror shown on occasion. Furthermore, its gentrification themes feel very forced and are done with absolutely no subtlety or nuance whatsoever, making it feel rather shallow and preachy relative to the original film. Finally, its entire third act is really poorly written, leaving viewers cheated and bored in the end. It has merits in its direction and design, but its actual substance leaves a lot to be desired and could have been done way better with more nuance and better writing.",NEGATIVE

340,"Reminiscence is clearly an ironic title for this film which is a pastiche of past, better works of many films including Joy's own brother in law's, Chris Nolan; films that include Inception and the Prestige. It evens mirrors and contains casts from Joy's other work, which was superior mind you: Westworld. Despite its stellar leads, this is Lisa Joy's first effort as a Director and it shows. Sure, she has all the best support staffs: but the film feels like a very long TV movie, and a good fit on HBO Max but not the cinemas.",POSITIVE
341,"This movie is good modern day action movie with a decent story on top of it all. The visuals along with the fighting were beautiful but due to the movie being PG, some fight scenes could have been more dramatic. I will say though that the movie should have been named differently as it doesn’t really feel like a snake eyes movie until the very end. If you are a G.I Joe fan looking for a movie about snake eyes then you might be disappointed, but if you are someone that’s just looking to watch an action movie then I’d say this movie is very enjoyable.",POSITIVE
342,"Ever since premiering at Sundance film festival to rave reviews, I've been looking forward to CODA but have always kept my expectations in check. CODA is a coming-of-age story sees Ruby (played by Emilia Jones in one of the best performances this year), a girl with a penchant for singing, grappling with chasing her dreams while helping her deaf family which she happens to be the only hearing member in. The story is nothing special, and the film itself is anything but groundbreaking. Rather, it's one that thrives off of its simplicity from which it yields enriching subtlety. For starters, the family dynamic is priceless. Whether they're squabbling or having a laugh, their interactions with each other are like quickfire repartees that have you transfixed while at play, and are sunk in as soon as they end. The humour in this movie originally generates either from how crude and blunt Ruby's family is (more on that later) or from the complexity of non-verbal communication. Yet, the movie never looks down at deaf people or even regards them patronizingly, and each time we spend some moments with the family makes this more and more evident. Does the same go for the family itself and each member of it? And are they perfectly imperfect as they seem? Not really. As the family has its own identity, each character has its own individual personality and unique mannerisms, too. And it's here where we get to see through the cracks in each one of them. Ruby is the one who communicates with them and the sign-language interpreter and mediator between them and the townspeople. Ironically, none of her family members is able to properly communicate their feelings to Ruby herself, the thing that made her dilemma more and more perplexing and befuddling. Ruby's brother, Leo, grows tired of people regarding him and his parents as 'disabled'. He feels that he's seen as helpless and ""freak"" — as one once called him before getting into a bar brawl. That feeling is further amplified when he realises how much they rely on his sister to be their connection to the outside world. As a consequence, he puts the blame on Ruby because he feels that he lives under her sister's shadow, let alone she's his younger sibling. In his heart, however, he loves his sister dearly. And after knowing of her talent, he becomes worried her potential might go to waste as a result of staying with them forever instead of pursuing her passion. As for the mother, Jackie, things are much more complicated. She bans Ruby from listening to music while they're at the table because that's 'rude' since it's not something ""[they] all can do together,"" and she's frustrated at learning she joined the school choir. Later on, she's desperate to do anything to stop her from heading off to the music school because that way they'd lose their only 'interpreter' they can't afford to keep their fishing business afloat. Thus, her actions and intentions seem to be solely based on the family's business' interests with a total disregard to Ruby's. She comes across as exploitative, and also as someone who clearly sees deafness as a deficiency that the whole family must suffer from. That said, it's revealed that all that has something to do with her past, which I'm not going to spoil but it shows how much Jackie's actually concerned about her relationship with her daughter. However, it's not only about her family, as Ruby herself has her own internal conflict and restrictions that she's built for herself — unwillingly, of course. On the face of it, she's ashamed of her family because of how shamelessly frank they are, especially her father, who legitimately got Ruby in some awkwardly embarrassing situations. On closer inspection, though, we see she's learned to adopt a new persona at school over the years because 'sounding like a deaf person' made her classmates make fun of her. Unfortunately, she learned to be normal by being different, only to become diffident. The whole thing about her inspiring, eccentric music teacher telling her that her problem is that she's ""holding her voice"" in the choir and at another occasion as though she's suppressing it, is a metaphor for her true self and identity she's been nearly stripped of unconsciously, whether because she's confined to her family's obligations or to avoid feelings of inadequacy and mortification. The second half of CODA is undeniably the weakest. As I mentioned earlier, the story itself is pretty formulaic, with its ups and downs, romantic storyline that slipped into cliché territory before even we're halfway through, and 'too-good-to-be-true' moments by the end. Nevertheless, CODA overflows with emotional beats that are bound to melt even the stony hearts, which the second half, in particular, is replete with. I mean, I almost teared up in three scenes! If that doesn't eclipse its shortcomings I don't know what does. Sweet, tender and earnest, CODA is a crowd-pleaser and one of the biggest surprises of the year.",POSITIVE

His motives can be relatable, I get that, but the actual villain of the movie is quite generic. What I can give kudos to this movie is that they managed to stay away from shoehorning other MARVEL heroes and rely on them to promote this movie or be a partial reason to see it (SpiderMan Homecoming as an example). Martial arts parts are great! But then....they are turned into CGI-fight. Movie needed more martial arts and less specticle. I feel like there are a bit too many characters here...and not enough time for all. Second half is a bit...well, more MARVEL and less Shang-Chi / Martial arts.

Brosnan is obviously having some fun with his role but his character is pretty awful. All of the characters are pretty awful to be honest. None of them feel relatable or have obvious intentions. Nothing really makes a ton of sense with this story. It’s a take on Rosemary’s Baby but it never really does anything with that. The main character has some hallucinations and thinks Brosnan is up to something and he is but the journey to get there is incredibly boring. All of the dialogue scenes are insufferable. The dialogue is awful and it never really contributes anything to the overall story. The ending is probably the worst ending to a film this year. It’s so out of left field and weird. I like weird conclusions but it doesn’t feel deserved at all and goes into some really dark places before going “just kidding”. Besides Brosnan, all of the performances are fine. They aren’t great but they aren’t Bad per say. I did enjoy the music sometimes but it was very standard and boring. The cinematography is incredibly bland. There isn’t any interesting shots at all besides maybe one or two. Some of the sets are kinda cool with the pure aesthetic hiding something dark. I would recommend not checking this out because it’s a disaster of a film that has the unadded bonus of being extremely boring.",NEGATIVE

Presented with minimal dialogue and background music, the film shows the various American venues where pieces of this hotly contested Cold War symbol have ended up. While some of the locales are obvious (museums, presidential libraries, parks, corporate headquarters, private collections), others are not, including the exterior grounds of a family-owned restaurant, a theme park, unincorporated lands and even a Chicago metro station. The curators of several of these landmarks offer their insights into the meaning of the wall segments, as well as their significance at a time when plans for another new wall are being put into a place in a land that claims to champion democracy and freedom from restriction, qualities that its East German predecessor sought to curtail. At a breezy-paced economical 68-minute runtime, directors Courtney Stephens and Pacho Velez have assembled a thought-provoking, visually appealing offering that gives us much to contemplate -- and not just the wall's place in history.",POSITIVE
370,"It goes in a very different direction that you may think, which is a nice surprise. Nick Cage gives a powerful subtle performance and reminds us that he's still a great actor when he wants to be. The cinematography is excellent; its a beautiful looking film. It's a somber slow-burn kind of film, and it won't be for everyone but I say it's worth checking out.",POSITIVE
371,A smart & sleek update to a 90's classic. Expands on the original lore in a modern and powerful way. Artistically shot with a great score and a modern twist. As a fan of the original I am happy to report that this film is excellent.,POSITIVE
372,"That really touched my heart too many times, many laughs too and I cried few times too. I have not laughed this much in a long time because of a movie. And I mean many laughs. The best deaf movie I’ve seen and I’m glad that I able to witness this in my lifetime, yes!",POSITIVE
373,"Films based on theme psrk rides have worked before (Pirates of the Caribbean); and some haven't worked at all (PotC sequels). This one's somewhere in between. There are good things in this film. The leads are excellent, the sets and cgi are very good, and there are a good number of entertaining set pieces. But it's incredibly uneven in tone. Tension is announced, rather than built, usually accompanied by an incredibly offputting Metallica based theme. The fight scenes are rather graphic for the genre too, putting it up to a 12 certificate (that's correct imo) and outside the ideal demographic. It would really have benefited from the touch of Speilberg or similar. There's no grandeur or scale to the cinematography and it really suffers for it. If it had decent photography, a Williams-esque soundtrack, and more child friendly action, then it could have been brilliant. Not everything can be Raiders, but this is doesn't come close.",NEGATIVE
374,A great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I loved the character conversations and moments. The fights throughout the film were incredible to watch. What kept me from rating this film any higher was the direction toward the end of the film. Overall this was a thrilling adventure and I hope to see more of Simu Liu in action soon.,POSITIVE
375,"It seems as though Jordan Peele and company saw the recent Halloween and thought we can do the same with Candyman. Acknowledging the original (ignoring the lesser sequels), with callbacks and characters from the original, while creating a continuation of the mythology. And even though the release was delayed by covid, it seems rushed. Very stylishly shot and well acted and directed, it would actually IMO benefit from a little longer running time. Good, when it could have been great.",POSITIVE

Maybe i'm not deep enough for this artsy stuff but i think your supposed to care about the characters, and i couldn't understand why i didn't.. Oh that's right the whole premise of the movie is to see a dark sub-culture of the poker world, with mr empty suit jacket himself as your tour guide. Sorry big fan of Paul and Martin's work, but why is Tiffany H in this movie, i've had bowel movement's with more chemistry than the dynamic between her and Oscar.

386,"I didn’t go into this with high expectations but I was very impressed with what I saw. This is the kind of horror I wish we would get more of. Some effective and creative jumpscares with interesting stories, characters and a lot of unsettling themes. This film deals with issues like suicide, depression, and mental illness and I think it makes use of them very efficiently to make you feel sympathetic and scared at the same time. There is a lot of ambiguity about what the monster is but in the end it’s nothing and I don’t mean there is nothing there but it deals with the idea that nothing is something. It sounds confusing but it makes sense with the film. I’ve never been a big fan of jumpscares but I think it’s super effective most of the time here. Most crappy horror film jumpscares get you for a second but you forget about them after they happened and this didn’t happen here. The scares stuck with me long after I saw them. David Bruckner’s directoral style helps give the film a sense if uneasiness and I think it works brilliantly for this story. Rebecca Hall gave a career best here. Her performance is pretty fantastic at points and her character is the best part of the movie. She feels relatable while having a fun personality that feels realistic. The film’s use of color and lighting at points also helps this uneasy atmosphere and the cinematography was super effective at some of these scares. I would highly recommend checking this out. It’s one of the more unique and interesting horror films I have seen in a while.",POSITIVE
387,"Simu Liu brings his charm and charisma from the hit Canadian comedy Kim’s Convenience to his role as the first Asian hero in the Marvel movie universe. He plays the son of a man with mighty powers, thanks to the titular bracelets. As his father prepares for a gargantuan task, he brings his son and daughter back to their home. Since this is an origin story, there are flashbacks that reveal more about their relationships. So much for plot. What we really care about is the action and this features some of the most beautifully choreographed fight sequences in the genre, primarily because of the focus on traditional martial arts techniques. The scenes on the bus and the skyscraper scaffolding are the highlights. Only the final dragon confrontation resorts to the typical CGI encounters. The other crucial aspect to making a superhero flick stand out is creating cool new visual approaches and there are several scenes that thrill the imagination. There’s also a sprinkling of humor, thanks primarily to the sidekick played by Awkwafina. The most enjoyable superhero movie since Black Panther. OF COURSE, stay thru the closing titles for one scene and thru ALL the credits for a final setup.",POSITIVE
388,"Generally not that bad but there are some anchors that pull it down to the mud. I liked the performance from Raynolds, although it was a bit predictable. The absolute lowpoint of the movie is Waititi's ""performance"", that dude should not be allowed within 1km of any movie production. Absolutely talentless, superbly irritating and without any merit. Single headedly ruined this movie experience for me at least. The move is in par with Ready Player One otherwise, visual effects are similar as well, also the ""necessary"" product placements and irritating YT streamers. For some people there are some ""trigger phrases like ""white privilege"" and ""manbaby"" so if you hate this kind of stuff, I totally not recommend this. This movie tries to reinforce stereotypes that all gamers are living in their mom's basement, and if you are playing a video game you are a bad smelling psychopathic **** Even the female gamers are portrayed as ""nerdy"" In my opinion the move does more harm to gamer culture then good. Although the core concept was not bad, interesting even and Raynolds's & Comer's performance was good, the adverts, the arrogant, stereotypical and condescending attitude of Waititi and the writers drags this movie to the mud.",NEGATIVE

393,"A near-phenomenal sequel to the 1992 classic. The reveal in the middle of the film had me in shock and the Candyman scenes were shot SO well! Anything Jordan Peele touches in anyway shape or form, is pure excellent. I'm very glad we didn't get Candyman scenes here and there throughout the film, he was prominent from start to finish. One of my favorite films this year! And of course, great to see Tony Todd again!",POSITIVE
394,"A monument to irrelevance. I don't understand how the original film spawned a sequel. I mean, I get it from the monetary aspect, but I'm quite shocked by the fact that Stephen Lang's character ended up becoming the lead. Is it that the writers and the public forgot that he was the bad guy? And that he really was a bad guy. Don't Breathe 2 tries too eagerly to make you believe that the once criminal should now be recognized as an anti-hero. And you know what, that element might have been more plausible if it weren't for the fact that in trying to do so, the writers sacrificed any attempt at an intelligent suspense, like in the original, for a rancid movie that mixes thriller with action, spiced up with an incredibly forced plot device. A total disappointment. I'm not surprised though.",NEGATIVE

397,"GO Streamers! I got bored this evening and gave in to watching a movie I was actively avoiding, Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins. Now, the movie is just called Snake Eyes but let's see what this movie about a beloved series has for us. Of course, this is clearly about the origin of the GI Joe character, Snake Eyes, before he became a Joe. Plain and simple. Let's see what we got. First, this is a stark departure from the story we've heard of Snake Eyes. Whether comic book or previous movies, this is just different and it's quite confusing. I, now, understand why people have been smashing into this movie over the last two weeks. I'll put it like this, the producers and director of this film found a way to make a really, cool and masterful character into an untrained Average Joe fighter. I actually don't know what they were thinking during writing, then during production and then even during post-production. I'm assuming people really were like, ""Yeah, we knocked this out of the park."" Or, were they thinking, ""I don't know about this... I hope people just show up during this pandemic out of desperation."" No, seriously, there were several points in this movie where I thought why are they forcing him to go in this direction. I, now, understand that it was in order to set up other characters and a sequel. Will there even really be a sequel or other Origin films? Nevertheless, the storyline made sense, it was just obvious, stereotypical and corny - almost offensively so at a couple points. For example, there is a moment towards the end, similar to Endgame, where there is a ""lady power"" team up and it was just soooo corny! I couldn't help but roll my eyes at the three most unimportant characters of the movie. Comparatively to the other GI Joe movies, this movie didn't have the purposefully corny/campy/funny feel. I actually think that in a way hurt how the viewers see the film. Had this been a bit more campy, I would have given certain scenes a break instead of a hard rolling my eyes. Other than that, the main cast was pretty good, except my guy Peter Mensah felt so out of place as the Blind Master. His performance wasn't poor, I mean, he's played this same role a few times before, but he's definitely the black sheep of the film, literally. I wish they had expanded upon him just a touch to make him make sense in that place where they don't let outsiders. But, I digress. Shout out to my guy, Iko Uwais, who also wasn't featured enough but entertained while he was around. Henry Golding was pretty solid as an action actor, but I will say his accent slipped in at times and I'm not even sure whether his character was supposed to be a Brit. The minor cast, characters like Scarlett and Baroness, are so whack and forgettable it was painful. As you can tell, I was pretty annoyed with this flick. I've never walked out on a movie, but this was the closest I've been. Not because the movie was bad, but because I was over it even though I knew the movie was about to end. That says a lot. Snake Eyes has entertaining fights but even those felt corny at times. The movie is between a single popped kernel and a handful because the movie is not only just average but it made me roll my eyes a few too many times to say watch if someone else wants to. So after this hits a streaming service, check it out after a good amount of scrolling.",NEGATIVE
398,"Best Marvel movie I have ever seen! The fights is amazing. I really like Tony Leung, he is not evil, just wanna save his wife.",POSITIVE
399,"It’s a lot of fun but it does have a lot of issues. The first part of this film is very cliche and very boring. In fact, a lot of this story feels very cliched. It was easy to start predicting which story beats the story was going to hit and it usually hit those beats with the climax being kind of the exception. Ryan Reynolds is definitely having fun in the role. He has this infectious charm that makes it hard to hate him and while his performance is by no means amazing, he is definitely trying. The other actors are fine but I didn’t really like Taika Waititi’s performance. Usually I love his performances but this time, it felt like he wasn’t even trying which sucked because he is the main villain. The references and cameos were definitely the best part of the film. Well, some of the cameos were fun while some of them felt really REALLY awkward. If you have seen the movie, then I think you know which people I am talking about. They all felt natural and not forced at all. I won’t spoil the cameos but there is one doing the final battle that got a genuine laugh out of me. Speaking of humor, it is pretty hit or miss. Some of it is pretty hilarious and some of it really falls flat on its face. Another big thing the film has is its climax. It doesn’t make a lot of sense but it’s just a ton of fun. There are plenty of moments throughout this film that were just fun and the climax dials it up to 11. It’s just a shame it takes a little while for it to become REALLY fun. If you enjoy video games or Reynold’s style of comedy then I would definitely recommend checking this out.",POSITIVE

403,"""ROADRUNNER: A Film About Anthony Bourdain,"" directed by Oscar-winner Morgan Neville (""20 Feet from Stardom""), shines a light on the fast life and tragic death by suicide in 2018 of celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain. The documentary accomplishes this using archival footage from Bourdain's hit television shows, ""No Reservations,"" ""Parts Unknown,"" ""The Layover,"" ""A Cook's Tour,"" along with interviews with him beginning in 1999 as he began writing his best selling book, ""Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly."" The film also includes interviews with various Bourdain family, friends and work colleagues. The grief of his loss is still very raw, evidence of this shown through the interviews in the documentary, leaving the audience with many theories and unanswered questions as to why Anthony Bourdain chose to commit suicide. Much like Bourdain was in life, the film never stops moving, taking you along for the accelerated journey of a man who was inventive, tempestuous, extraordinary, and deeply flawed.",POSITIVE

406,"I could not believe that a movie based on an Ubisoft VR game was getting such great reviews. Then I saw that it had Sam Richardson and I had a good guess as to why. Sam is one of those performers that I could watch in anything and he delivered an amazing performance here amongst other engrossing comedic actors. The chemistry between Sam and the on screen love interest, Milana Vayntrub, was palpable. I know they adapted the story for the movie and they made so many great choices. The setting of a small town in the dead of winter really set the mood. For a horror movie that is rated R there wasn’t a lot of gore. I think it’s more because of the language that this movie earned an R rating, but there is a lot of violence. There are things about the style of editing that are a little over used in this genre of movie, but the quick cuts weren’t too many for me to be taken out of the action and didn’t mess with the pacing either. The mystery they set up is pretty good as well. I’m not kidding when I say I could have started the movie over and watched it again I had that much fun with it. I’d recommend this for anyone looking to spend some time enjoying an evening in.",POSITIVE
407,"Wow, this movie was honestly a lot better than I thought it'd be. The action was well done, had good humor, and had a good story with great CGI in it. I was engaged throughout it. The acting was good and believable, especially by the antagonist. I'm impressed and proved wrong, I didn't expect a movie of this level. Not impressed by the soundtrack, but that doesn't take away much from the experiance.",POSITIVE
408,"Happy weekend, Streamers! The much-anticipated new movie from M. Night Shyamalan, Old, was released in theaters July 23, 2021. Shyamalan has a weird reputation marred by directorial inconsistencies from the highs of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable to the lows of The Last Airbender and The Happening. From his filmography, the one thing you can say about Shyamalan is that he swings for the fences. In that regard, Old is no exception. I am usually up for giving Shyamalan a chance to surprise me. Here's how he did with Old. Shyamalan wrote the screenplay for Old based on a graphic novel. The story centers on a family, who takes a trip to a resort and ends up on an idyllic, secluded beach that isn't what it seems. Very soon, the family, who are joined by fellow travelers to the resort, begins to realize that strange things are happening at the beach - mainly, the children begin to age rapidly. Then, they have to figure out what's going on on this beach and why they cannot seem to leave. Shyamalan focuses on the emotional dynamics of the parents and children layering a family drama on top of the creepy thriller, and both sides are moderately successful. The parents of the main family are played by Gael Garcia Bernal and Vicky Krieps. They are both fine, though I don't believe them as any kind of couple. Bernal and Krieps, especially, do well with showing their growing concern about this strange beach as well as balancing the simmering turmoil underneath the surface of their marriage. Rufus Sewell and Aaron Pierre play pivotal roles as fellow travelers stranded on this beach. Each has creepy moments that they play to the hilt giving Old a horror movie edge that it needs. Really, Old suffers because it feels like the movie is biding its time searching for an explanation to its premise. The dialogue throughout does too much forecasting about what's to come without being more than just obvious breadcrumbs of things to come. There is one scene that addresses the emotional stakes of the movie, but it comes late in the game so hopefully you're still attuned to what the film wants to say - particularly about aging. Unfortunately, the angst that is displayed as the film moves towards its finale does not pay off as it should - even though the cast does its best. Ultimately, I cannot recommend paying even matinee prices for Old. I say grabbing a handful of popcorn should do it for Old as it's not worth braving the confines of a dark theater. While there is an interesting premise here, Old does not rise above the level of window-dressing even though some actors really give their all. Give Old a shot when it appears on a streaming service - you may thank me.",POSITIVE
409,"Despite a strong cast, the movie is cluttered and the narrative muddy enough to be incomprehensible in places. Too many moving parts, not enough groundwork for their movements to tell a story.",NEGATIVE
410,"Feels like a bad episode of 'Lost.' Meh acting, bad dialogue, and weird character development make this film a very forgettable one. 'Old' parts from a good idea of putting the characters against their greatest enemy: mortality; but the way the story unfolds is borderline silly. And what was all that about with those awkward scenes and butt shots? Shyamalan keeps on disappointing.",NEGATIVE
411,"Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson have teamed up again to star in a neo-noir style sci-fi drama that is reminiscent of other movies like Strange Days, Inception and Blade Runner. Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) is a private investigator of the mind, navigating the alluring world of memories and nostalgia. His life changes forever when he meets a new client, Mae (Rebecca Ferguson). What begins as a simple case soon becomes an obsession for Nick after Mae suddenly disappears and he desperately tries to learn the truth and if she really was the woman he thought she was. It’s entertaining and enjoyable to watch in the moment. There might be a bit of a missed opportunity here as there is a lot going on and perhaps the most impressive thing about Reminiscence is the world building it has created. Set in a dystopian future where due to the devastating effects of global warming many parts of the city is either underwater or badly flooded. The city only opens up at night due to the extreme heat during the daytime, this very much adds to the neo-noir theme. The ultra-rich have built dams allowing them to live comfortably in the drylands, leaving the poorer members of society to live in the flooded remains of the city. There’s enough storylines here about class division and corrupt police to expand on but it’s limited to a two hour movie. I liked it but the main story does feel like something we’ve seen before. From a technical point of view Reminiscence is very impressive and clearly in the hands of a director (Lisa Joy) who knows what she’s doing. The fight scenes are well done and very clear, no shaky cam anywhere which is always a bonus. Also added to the cast are Thandiwe Newton and Cliff Curtis, both giving impressive performances. I’m not surprised to see Jackman and Ferguson appear again in another movie after their onscreen chemistry in The Greatest Showman. However, unlike The Greatest Showman Rebecca Ferguson actually has the chance to show off her impressive vocals in Reminiscence. The soundtrack is worth listening to, both for Ferguson’s seductive singing and Ramin Djawadi’s original score. I felt nostalgic watching Reminiscence, which considering the film’s topic is very appropriate. Recommended for the Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson fans.",POSITIVE
412,"For a film that I wasn't especially looking forward to, this latest offering from the Marvel Universe certainly surprised me. While the trailer appeared to bill this as little more than a grandiose martial arts movie, director Destin Daniel Cretton's latest has an epic quality about it, presenting a story that's mythic in nature and infused with themes related to morality, personal evolution and coming into one's own, qualities not often found in releases like this. The picture is essentially an origin story piece in the same vein as ""Captain Marvel"" and ""Black Panther,"" with a narrative that mirrors both of these cinematic predecessors but with better overall execution, especially in the writing and pacing. Besides its captivating story and well-orchestrated (though generally not overdone) action sequences, this offering features ample comic relief, unexpected touches of whimsy and surprisingly good performances, especially from Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh and Ben Kingsley. While the film's closing act is admittedly a little too drawn out, that's a small price to pay for everything else it has to offer. ""Shang-chi"" is easily one of the best films of the summer season and one of the finest additions to the Marvel Universe to come along in quite some time. Action-adventure fans will surely enjoy it, but even those generally less drawn to this genre will likely come away from this one having had a good, uplifting and entertaining time.",POSITIVE

414,"Ryan Reynolds stars as a background player in a video game. One day he discovers that he can step out of his assigned role and become a superhero, which leads him to a new world and a girlfriend (Jodie Comer). Not only does Comer prove a delightful comic presence, there are other enjoyable supporting roles including Taika Waititi, LilRel Howery and Channing Tatum. Of course, the star is still Reynolds and his charismatic charm and self-aware timing are in full force. It helps that the script is peppered with funny concepts, on top of the animated game world that fills the screen with zany visuals. Since CGI technicians can create pretty much design anything, it’s up to their creativity to keep them interesting. They mostly succeed. Director Shawn Levy has kept the whole thing bright and sunny, while milking the most fun from every actor. It’s the kind of snappy, clever entertainment we’ve come to expect from Reynolds.",POSITIVE

416,I’m not sure what to say but it’s looking like Vin and the rest of the bunch have taken the Fast and the Furious as far as they can take it. F9 is confusing in that they don’t know if they want to be a comedy movie or a spy thriller. I thought these films were supposed to be about fast cars and Street Racing? Somewhere along the lines it was forgotten. Don’t get me wrong when they first started straying away from cars and racing it was cool because there’s only so much you can do with that. The problem now is that most of the cast is getting too old to be believable as crime fighters. Also they threw out the whole “they might die at any moment” suspense with the bringing back of dead characters more times than makes sense. In my opinion it’s time Vin Diesel and the old timers let go and let the Tokyo Drift guys get a shot at carrying the series.,NEGATIVE
417,"I did not expect realism. I expected full and crazy action, Roman's funny lines and beautiful environments. It definitely delivered and I was happy with the movie.

In the early scenes, the local mail carrier (Milana Vayntrub) takes him around to meet the town’s quirky citizens. Sadly, most of them aren’t that quirky…just trying too hard. This develops into a classic whodunit with everyone a suspect. The combo of comedy/thriller never materializes on either level. Although there’s plenty of comic energy, it doesn’t translate into a lot of genuine funny. Even when the creature does attack, it’s not remotely scary. While making a robust effort, this film doesn’t deliver on its eccentric promise.",NEGATIVE

I can't see a single thing wrong with Malignant, it's, at least, worth seeing, and that's all that really matters.",POSITIVE
428,"HORRIBLE! Characters are so wooden and psychologically unbelievable you'll find yourself thinking over and over again: in the crazy situation they are in, THIS is what they are compelled to focus on? A REALLY bad movie and I'm the kind of person who tries to find the silver lining. But this time, I couldn't find anything. Okay, the beach shots are nice. But that's about the ONLY good thing about this movie. The ending is pure ridiculousness too.",NEGATIVE
429,"This was suck a nice change of pace for Marvel Studios. It didn't feel like a superhero movie this time, it felt like a real martial arts movie.",POSITIVE
430,"Excellent performances from Annabelle Wallis Marina Mazepa, and Ray Chase, superb special effects makeup, outstanding visual effects, as well as its very fresh and unique twist make up for Malignant's uneven tone at time and cheesy moments.",POSITIVE
431,"The search for connection is something that we all understand, not only as a social practice, but also as a personal and collective need. So, when we hear about an individual who is unable to fulfill that requirement, we're often saddened by this deficiency, regardless of whether this circumstance involves a human or some other creature. Such is the case for a believed-hybrid whale that sings its songs on a unique frequency, making it fundamentally unable to communicate with its peers and causing it to labeled as the ultimate social outcast. This has thus led to the emergence of a mythology sentimentally celebrated in story and even song, all backed by an abundance of empathy for this loner of the deep, a creature that has come to be known as ""the loneliest whale."" The search for this elusive cetacean provides the focus of filmmaker Joshua Zeman's captivating new documentary, which shares the story of this solitary specimen and the long-shot expedition launched to find it. The film generally tells the tale in a beautifully filmed and engaging vehicle, though it has unfortunate tendencies to slip off into tangents that are awkwardly introduced and to insert annoying, somewhat self-aggrandizing observations from the director/narrator, intrusions that needlessly impede the flow of the narrative. Nevertheless, this offering also draws a number of relevant and pertinent parallels between the human condition and that of the lonely whale and its kindreds, metaphorical parables that we had all better heed if we hope to save the whales -- and ourselves.",POSITIVE
432,"This was unfortunately a pretty uninspired, boring and a needlessly long movie that is abusing the flasback system and is almost entirely made of exposition.Once someone interesting shows up the focus is changed back to the main characters making you wonder why they would tease us with a interesting persona and then never show them again , the comedy was pretty bad to be honest and it should have focused more on the comic relief than at the characters trying to make jokes. The only positive thing that I can tell about this movie that the small amount of fights were pretty great and badass , especially the bus scene.Music is forgetful and the acting was awkward and not that fine.",NEGATIVE
433,This movie is competent for an action movie of the same category as John Wick and Atomic blonde. A tad bit more stylish than others but way to predictable in story. Mary does pull off the badass type but the plot doesn't do her favors.,NEGATIVE
434,"Definitely, this script was written by a sexually frustrated junkie with a dumb brain; an actual film experiment went wrong! Well, these definitive vocabularies will describe the film: pathetic, dismal, dreary, heartbreaking, heartrending, melancholy, mournful, sad, saddening, sorry, tearful, asinine, balmy, brainless, bubbleheaded, cockeyed, crackpot, crazy, cuckoo, daffy, daft, dippy, dotty, fatuous, feather-headed, fool, foolish, half-baked, half-witted, harebrained, inept, insane, jerky, kooky (also kookie), loony (also looney), lunatic, lunkheaded, mad, nonsensical, nutty, preposterous, sappy, screwball, senseless, silly, simpleminded, stupid, tomfool, unwise, wacky (also whacky), weak-minded, witless, zany and depressing! An absolute bad example of si-fi and creativity and was definitely written by a sexually frustrated junkie with a dumb brain. The worst depiction follows a cheating wife talking like a three-year-old, a kid who impregnates another kid, a kid asking her mom to change her bra because her breast doesn't fit in. The most horrible part was a cardiothoracic surgeon who doesn't know anything about medicine, so it seemed! Yes, it was a si-fi movie but for instance an example like Angelman syndrome could led a person have Intellectual disability forever and now in this film you depicted a 5 year old developing the brain and understating the full functionality of the human body? Growing one's hunger for sex and blah blah blah, are you kidding me? It could have been described better with unique creativity. And with all this, was this film rated PG-13? What! I couldn't understand why was your camera shaking while filming the movie, was it because to add some special effects? Didn't work though! This is what happens when people don't use their brains anymore! It could have been an epic with the concept, but alas, this experiment was unsuccessful! Don't watch this crap will just frustrate you even further!",NEGATIVE
435,"Outside the other celebrity cameos and behind the scenes footage, I was pretty disappointed. Pretty pretentious, which doesn't surprise me given Kilmer's ego, but even for him it's too much for me. I respect he went to Julliard and really put everything into his acting, but this comes off like he really enjoys the flavor of his own Kool-Aid. Even though it's a documentary, it is very contrived and scripted.",NEGATIVE
436,"I can't suggest this movie enough. The way they thought of this scenario in this movie to bring another toretto and also bring back some loved characters. Amazing movie, if you haven't watched this movie then what are you doing just go and give a shot . Trust me you won't be disappointed.",POSITIVE
437,Amazing movie! Loved every bit of it. Glad it was not whitewashed. I'm over these white washed movies stolen from other ethnic groups. More movies like this.,POSITIVE
438,P######ta filme ruim da porr@! Nem se iludam por ser o diretor de outros filmes aclamados. Aqui você vai encontrar um filme gore e uma história MUITA tosca! Não vale o tempo perdido.,NEGATIVE
439,Good MA. Strong pick for the lead. Too much bs comic relief and unnecessary sidekicks and a bizarre resurrection of a mistake the MCU made in a previous poorly done movie. It’s like they tried to justify that mistake and it weighted down this story with a stupid add that just didn’t need to be there. Also some of the “animals” they used for a fantasy environment smacked of Pokémon. Just a shame. Has the elements to be great but missed the mark.,NEGATIVE
440,"Oh my god...there actually did it. 'F9' is wild, bonkers, fun, stupid, and really stupid. However, nine movies in, I fully accept its ridiculousness, and for the shake of your insanity, you should too. It's funny how nobody really dies in these movies, and how the movie explains why a certain characters is somehow alive makes no sense at all. There's always betrayal in the ""family"" but at the end it's alright. The soundtrack is different in every movie but it sounds the same. Honestly, I'm interested how ridiculous it can go. Helen Mirren is right when she said ""You don't really need to act in these movies. It's good fun"".",POSITIVE
441,Un film che sa di cosa si tratta e se lo gode fino alla fine. Un grande successo per i Marvel Studios.,POSITIVE
442,"Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays the titular character, yet another pro assassin who’s trying to track down the person responsible her poisoning. The only new thing this adds is that she has 24 hours to live. She even teams up with a Japanese teen for some emotional weight. This is latest entry into the fast-growing kick-ass chicks genre, like the recent Amazon release Jolt. The action is what make them matter and there are some well-choreographed fights with plenty of breaking bones, flying bodies and endless bullets. Otherwise, it’s pretty much standard fare.",POSITIVE
443,Ryan Reynolds makes this movie - it’s So feel good. Don’t expect some deep weighty movie…. But you’ll we feel good when you leave,POSITIVE
444,"""CODA"" mostra na prática o que é ter um sonho sem ninguém ao seu redor entendê-lo. Marlee Matlin continua incrível desde ""Children of a Lesser God"" e Emilia Jones foi uma ótima escolha para o papel principal. Seria ótimo ver ambas na próxima temporada de premiações. Alô, Oscar!",NEGATIVE
445,"Action was amazing , visuals were stunning plot had some slows but overall it was an emotional joy ride for me, I cried twice cause I could release to the story in some ways.Sim Lu has charm and potential. He’s a very down to earth character which is good. But the MVP in Tony Leung’s Mandarin is outstanding.",POSITIVE
446,"I have seen all the Purge films and part of the tv series. The magic that made the franchise intriguing left the building about 3 movies ago. This movie is so woke that it makes stupid ""Orange Man Bad"" jokes 6 or 7 months after the man got booted from office. Kinda makes me laugh because your adding real elements into a fictional universe when the only people who are ""purging"" right now are the far left. This film is recommended for those who think that Lovecraft Country or the HBO Watchmen series are good continuations of the works of the original authors HP Lovecraft or Alan Moore. It is also recommended for woketards and for communists who are so preoccupied with labeling people with acronyms that they've used atleast a 3rd of the alphabet to come up with a grievance group.

450,"It was going good until they introduced the ""magical world""...it went from MCU to Godzilla / Never Ending Story....riding a dragon???....really?? The Godzilla inspired monster fights with a dragon was way too much. The MCU worked in the past because although it's based on comic book characters, they tried to keep it grounded as much as possible, but now it's just feel very....Disney....all it needs is a Disney princess to be introduced. Unless the kiddish magic gets toned down in the other movies the new phase of the MCU is going to be a disappointment.",NEGATIVE
451,When it isn't beating you over the head with its preachy and reductive politics it's underwhelming you with its lack of action or horror. Go watch the much better 2006 The Hills Have Eyes instead - 2 stars,NEGATIVE
452,"Man bad, women good. That's the moral here. This idea that nature is inherently noble and that men (specifically men because all the bad guys are men in this) just don't get it. The reality is, and something feminists and the LGBTQ community fail to grasp, is that nature is not inherently noble, it simply seeks to support its biological imperatives. No other species tries to change its very nature to suit its desires. And nowhere else, but in nature, will you see brutal savagery greeted with calm passivity. Gazelles don't protest against predators. The animation, while interesting, is not great. It looks like something a child drew. I know, I know, Picasso famously said he spent his life learning to draw like a child. He was also a womanizer and a complete misogynist, but I guess we'll overlook that. This is a miss for me.",NEGATIVE
453,"This film is not the next inception that the advertising made it seem. The film emphasis on the noir, investigative story than on the sci-fi premise. The world building is almost non existent. It could've been set in the near future and not much would have changed. Hugh Jackman acting is great as he gives so much exposition with a soothing voice (it's actually important to the movie). Give this one a try if you want to see a middle of the road sci-fi film.",POSITIVE

455,"Wow...I did not expect this at all.The trailer gave me the impression that this would be another no brain movie.But i was super wrong.This movie delivered on all fronts.Insane action(the bus scene is one of my favorite marvel movie fights ever).A touching story ,good visuals and good performances from the actors,especially the villain.My only negative point is that the ending was a bit less impressive and fleshed out like the other 100 minutes of the movie but it was still great.",POSITIVE
456,"Um filme epico, sem palavras pra descrever as cenas de ação que esse filme trouxe.. Marvel está de parabéns, esse pode ser o melhor filme solo de ação da marvel facilmente.. Trouxe tudo o que é de bom em um filme de artes marciais. E o humor não incomodou nem um pouco. Nota 10",NEGATIVE
457,"o filme mais divertido de 2021, ótimo elenco, vale a pena ver com a família",POSITIVE
458,This is yet another interesting thriller from M. Night. One with a premise that carries most of the movie. The actors play there parts well and realistically react to the horrors that are occurring to them. The movie does seem to slow down while all the characters make dumb choices that keep the movie halted. After a certain point you are just waiting for the inevitable to occur. Overall really unique and enjoyable.,POSITIVE
459,"'Jurassic Park' meets 'Missing Link.' Yes, the last act goes into blockbuster territory, but I loved Dash Shaw's idea of a mythological zoo. Also, there's a relevant meditation about the complicated and almost always destructive relationship between humans and nature. Not a perfect film, but quite enjoyable.",POSITIVE
460,"If you love shaky cam then you'll love this movie. Seriously, the camera is shaking so much that is literally impossible to see what is going on. DO. NOT. WATCH.",POSITIVE
461,"My goodness. This is seriously weak sauce. I struggled to get through it, and ended up skipping quite a bit. Felt like someone using two hours to tell a really boring story.",NEGATIVE
462,"Ryan Reynolds carries some of that Deadpool spark into a fun gamer sci-fi. Compared to the characters of Deadpool and Jodie Comer's Villanelle, 'Free Guy' is almost a family film. Almost. It certainly contains some plot holes and even some romance clichés, but it was fun and entertaining from beginning to end. Definitely worth the admission price.",POSITIVE
463,"Anything over a 5 rating is flat out someone selling the film. James Wan shows very little of his ability in this pretty boring horror film. The script is standard fare at best. We’ve seen similar so many times; often better executed. The scares are cheap and tired. It gets a 4 rating only because of some nice visuals and set pieces. And for those saying it’s a homage to 80’s horror, well just go back and watch one of those. You’re wasting your time with this one.",NEGATIVE
464,"In a franchise first, I'm finally starting to see what other, higher-minded critics have been seeing in this franchise for the past movie or so. For me, though, it really all comes down to the screenplay. With this being the Chris Morgan's (the franchise's reigning screenwriter) first absence of any kind since the first two films, oddly enough, you really can feel it. The job done by Daniel Casey and director Justin Lin this time around is serviceable, but ultimately feels too much like a pastiche version of what Morgan would have come up with. There's only semi-solid performance work, what with the cast conjuring up more ""going through the motions"" vibes than I would have liked. Still, the set-piece design gets the job done, with John Cena's addition mostly adding something new here and there. Here's hoping this lesser entry amounts to nothing more than a blip in the franchise's recent hot streak.",NEGATIVE
465,"Like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, the war has scarred Oscar Isaac's card counting poker/blackjack player William Tell. He is a loner traveling up and down the East Coast winning small pots at poker games in B & C level casinos, and stays off the griad as best as he can. Tiffany Haddish's character sees him at various tournaments and is intrigued. Someone out of William Tell's militay past seeks him out and William Tell see's the opportunity as a chance @ redemption. Sadly, things don't always work out the way we hoped. Fascinating character study. Great cast, directing and script",POSITIVE
466,"I said it when I reviewed The Fate of the Furious. ''They're going to space after that one''. And they did. At this point, exaggeration is the strongest point of this franchise. Betting on less means a lesser show, and you have to admit that nobody is interested in the story. Proof of this, is the banal explanation for Han's ""resurrection"". No, what people want, and what this franchise has become so famous for, is to see what kind of crazy stunt they will come up with this new occasion. And now the special guest is magnetism, and of course the little trip to space. F9 certainly delivers in that department, because that's the show. Any laws of physics and reality about the human body are completely forgotten at all times, and the audience knows it, the audiences love it, and they don't fool themselves. It is what it is. Is it necessary to mention the plot? Well yes, a little. A real disaster, of course. It seems like they just make up **** as they go along, but it's been like that since the sixth movie, so there's no surprise about it. It's a winning, predictable, and safe formula. C'mon, if we are already in number 9, and 10 and 11 are coming on the pipeline, expecting something else is laughable. Turn off your brain, and enjoy hassle-free entertainment. If it's not your thing, what else do you expect me to tell you?",POSITIVE
467,Boring character. Awkwafina was as annoying as ever and ruined every scene she was in.,NEGATIVE

Jednak nie mogę się doczekać pierwszych interakcji Shang-Chiego z resztą ekipy Avengers",NEGATIVE
471,"Посмотрел вчера ""Круиз по джунглям"" и вот какое мнение у меня сложилось. Скажу сразу кино выглядит неплохо, узнаваемые актёры, разрушения, колдовство. Это такой приключенческий боевичок в джунглях, для детей от 7 до 15 лет. Сам сюжет мне жесточайшим образом напомнил смесь фильмов ""Мумия"" 1999 и ""Пиратов Карибского моря"" 2003 годов выпуска. Фильм сочный, красивый и, и,.....и пожалуй это всё, что хорошего я могу о нем сказать. Теперь о том, что мне не очень или совсем не понравилось. Это злодеи. Они ну просто ужасны с точки зрения злодеев. Вспомнить хоть Барбоссу или Имхотепа из выше перечисленных фильмов. В Круизе по джунглям это какой то свинообразный немецкий принц?, который пол фильма ходит с гербом Российской империи на шее. А также ""проклятые канкистадоры""...ну ё маё. Сравнить проклятых пиратов с Чёрной жемчужины и этих. Те ходячие мертвецы эти клоуны, один состоит из говна, ну реально дерьмодемон, второй из мёда и сот, где ты Винни Пух, третий из змей, какая чушь. Единственный проклятый это такой Грут, состоит из веток и корней, не вызывает смеха. Герои тоже те ещё. Женщина которая круче всех мужиков, братан гей и нарисованный ягуар. Охренеть. Ну конечно баба вождь...местных дикарей, разговаривающих на английском не хуже лордов, это же начало 20го века, ёлы палы. Ну прочих глупостей как то кораблик который с одним винтом и движком в 10 лошадей может легко уплыть от водопада и вообще творит какие то чудеса на воде, подводная лодка в реке и прочей несуразности в фильме тоже до фига. Ну и скала Джонсон, ну честное слово, воспринимается уже как наш Безруков, в каждом фильме затычка. Резюмирую. В отличии от тех же Пиратов и Мумии этот фильм, ну лично для меня, на один просмотр. Рекомендую всем детям от 7 до 15 лет. Взрослым не рекомендуется, это же Дисней в конце концов!",NEGATIVE
472,"Shang Chi is an awesome MCU movie, an awesome action movie, an awesome martial arts movie, and an awesome family dynamic movie. The fight choreography is flawless and the story is very well done. It is very much worth the risk of seeing in theatres.",POSITIVE
473,"Best Marvel villain in a long time. The development of Wenwu is one of the highlights of this film, and the father/son relationship is the heart of it. Unfortunately, 'Shang Chi' feels very generic; the last act is just bonkers, and the second one is kind of boring. The best: the first fight sequences — in the forest and on the bus —. I really appreciate representation, but I wished Marvel could've come up with a more attractive story.",POSITIVE
474,"Excellent performances, beautiful look. One not to miss. Nicolas Cage is making the right choices.",POSITIVE
475,"It has an interesting premise and I was entertained during the whole viewing. Nonetheless, the dialogues and writing in general are frequently a nonsense. Acting is mediocre as it is the plot twist. But again, I was entertained.",POSITIVE
476,"Solid! Not as exciting as the first one, but still has some strong thrills. Ultimately this is an emotional story about a young girl struggling to figure out who her ""real family"" is when every grownup around her turns out to be ... well ... no spoilers. The story does a great job of sticking to that basic idea, and putting it through twists and turns right up until the end. If you like thrillers, see this in theaters!",POSITIVE
477,"A história e o conceito são muito interessantes, apesar do ritmo ser lento e a construção não ter se dado da melhor forma. De qualquer forma, não entendo porque o filme está sendo tão massacrado.",NEGATIVE
478,"Hugh Jackman plays a man who runs a facility that allows people to relive memories. A woman (Rebecca Ferguson) shows up as a customer, but ends up in a tangled love affair. Needless to say, this includes danger, murder and conspiracy. While it’s sufficiently interesting, the story or direction never grip the emotions or surprise expectations (and some of the tech fails logic). With the constant voiceover and a reality altered by a failing environment, the film harkens back to the original Blade Runner. The movie’s coolest feature is Miami’s partially submerged underwater world (the piano fight scene is the visual highlight). Overall, this is a rather pedestrian film noir that’s major asset is the CGI city.",POSITIVE
479,"A Lot Of Fun While it’s not the franchise’s best, F9 is still a lot fun with over the top action, Good humor, and solid performances.",POSITIVE
480,Truly Loved this Movie! It's probably some Ryan Reynolds best acting since Woman in Gold. But where was the GIANT VE SHARK Dude?,POSITIVE
481,"I don’t know why this movie has bad acting, worse dialogue and is truly insulting to the audience’s intelligence with its disjointed events. I feel that all of it on the borderline of being intentional with its silliness that I am not sure if it is a parody or not. Lastly, one of the main reasons I made this review is to say (Watching this movie really made me “Old”), I literally feel that I lost 50 years of my life.",NEGATIVE
482,"The Show has great performances, direction, and cinematography. What it boils down to is whether you'll get on with its Twin Peaks-like mystery story, which for me was so-so. Great to see Alan Moore in the film.",POSITIVE
483,"The movie isn't a cinematic masterpiece, but it had a celebrity cast, so I wasn't expecting it to be. Nor should anyone. Yet I do believe it was unfairly torn apart because it was torn apart for the wrong reasons from my experiences. Coming from someone who actually didn't think the movie looked that bad going in. If you're not part of a mainstream demographic or like to believe you have superior taste in movies, this isn't the film for you. If you just want a quick laugh or something to watch with the family then this is a good film for what it is. For once Disney uses typecasting to their advantage with this one. Jack Whitehall was a great pick for his character and shows he doesn't have to rely on sex jokes to be funny. Although the ""haha British posh boy"" jokes can get crating, thankfully the writers had the common sense to break up the actual story and the calmer moments. Plus he and The Rock are an interesting duo. Perhaps with some reworking with some of the jokes Disney could've boosted the movie's quality here. Emily Blunt did her job. I think she had a strong introduction to her character, but like with most of the characters, they lose that charm they had once the actual story kicks in. Though Emily's character ""Lily"" manages to survive this the best. There's nothing more to say really. Would recommend watching it for a laugh if you want a chill afternoon. But if you're someone who looks for movies to leave an impact, then why did you turn to a live-action Disney movie for that??",NEGATIVE
484,"Much better than I expected. The many critics who don't get F9 don't seem to understand this can only be judged on the level of comic book tropes, characters and narrative. F9 is not a serious movie. It is glorious movie-making--as long as a comic book world view is acceptable to you. This is Marvel-level filmmaking with a less than Marvel-level plot. Notice in comic books, it is acceptable to kill as many innocent bystanders as the latest spectacle demands. In the best of these movies, it is the velocity and momentum which allows all nonsensical pieces to hang together. When the DVD comes out, watch it with the sound turned off. Play your own music if you like. You will see the flow and velocity are foreground; everything else is background. Black Widow is similar in this regard. If you liked Black Widow, I dare you judge F9 much differently.",POSITIVE
485,"An unashamed John Wick action clone, but without the world building to make the story compelling. It is also peppered with certain camera framings you can tell the director insisted on only to clumsily recreate their anime inspirations. It is also painfully clear which scenes were filmed in another country due to the unrealistic emphasis on neon signage. The bright spot was the above average acting of the Japanese cast, despite some accent issues.",NEGATIVE
486,"Honestly, I was concerned going into this film, as someone who has adored the marvel cinematic universe up to this point, I didn’t know how they would be able to pull off a new phase with so many new IP’s coming into play and so many of the beloved favourites being finished with. After the relatively underwhelming Black Widow, and trailers that didn’t do anything to get me excited, I went into SCatLotTR (good lord that’s a long title..) with reservations, however, I’m delighted to say, they were absolutely unnecessary, Shang Chi is an absolute blast, and delivers so much more than the trailer led on. With genuinely likeable characters, solid visuals, an excellent soundtrack and a plot that, though familiar, is delivered in such a way as to never leave the audience bored or underwhelmed, the film had me captivated from start to finish. Though I don’t intend to spoil major plot points, I will say, the Kaiju-like finale was unexpected but a genuine spectacle! This in honestly one of the strongest Marvel origin story films yet, up there with Iron Man and Spider-Man Homecoming. Go see it and keep supporting cinema!",POSITIVE
487,Je n'ai pas été aussi satisfait d'un film de super-héros depuis que j'ai vu Aquaman en 2018.,POSITIVE
488,A refreshing and genuine film that I don't want to spoil. I recommend going into this movie as blind as possible (the trailer does not give away much anyways). Just don't expect an action or comedy movie. There are some humorous moments but the film is primarily a drama. Cage gives his best performance since... well pretty much forever.,POSITIVE
489,"An intriguing story that keeps you on the edge of your seat on what's happening on this tropical island, with of course the classic twist that m night shyamalan always brings to his movies, it's definitely worth a watch",POSITIVE
490,"I am not sure I ever gave a movie a ""10"" before. But when a movie leaves you wanting more, inspired to write a creative story such as this, and go search who Edson Oda is and what else he has done, then you got to give the props where due. I would not want to give anything away because the unraveling of this movie package is what makes this movie so special. The stars, Winston Duke and Zazie Beetz have been bit actors up to now, and when they were given the baton to run, they took off like they had a a jet fuel pack strapped to their backs. I hope the screenplay, the director and these actors get Oscar consideration. Please see this in any format you can, because it is so worth seeing.",POSITIVE
491,"Completely blown away by this film. It was more than I expected! The movie has so many different layers in regards to its characters and how they keep descending into this underworld of prostitution, sex trafficking, and murder. It got pretty scary at times but I thoroughly enjoyed it!",POSITIVE
492,Jennifer is Amazing thank you for this incredible movie for the Queen of soul,POSITIVE
493,"This movie is no masterpiece; it has its fair share of plot holes and contrivances, but man is this movie fun. Like most movies, it is about expectations. Don't expect a gritty sci-fi which faces the morality of artificial intelligence (but come on it has Ryan Reynolds, you already knew that), go in expecting a fun time. Watch this movie, it is great.",POSITIVE
494,"This ""heist"" movie made no sense in the end, the Black mob boss let's the guy go, WITH 5k AFTER being out 25k for his initial ineptitude AND 50k to pay off the cops? Why would he do this ""deal""? For his notebook? Then why would he let him go? Also, the writers crack said by Cheadle with a sarcastic eyeroll ""stein yeah I can see how that's a disadvantage"", where this was set in 1950's less than 10 years after 6 million Jews were slaughtered by the Nazis. What a weird bit of antisemitism plugged in there at the end. The style of this movie was there, but the substance was garbage.",NEGATIVE
495,Learning of Aretha's activism was inspiring in my current walk. Costuming was beautiful. Jennifer Hudson performance was powerful. I hope they hat therapists on set because film had a lot to unpack in terms of American history and trauma.,POSITIVE
496,this was a great follow up film...way more relatable to me then the first one although the story could have been tighter i do not regret paying 10$ to see this film i was entertained,POSITIVE
497,M. Night stole money from me and I was duped by the intriguing trailer. My wife and I walked out of the theater before the movie ended. We have never done this before yet this movie was unbearable to watch. Moronic dialogue and horrible acting are what stands out within the first five minutes. It’s astonishing that a studio green lit such childish and elementary writing. Not a single actor/actress in this movie delivered their dialogues naturally either. I hate being duped out of my money.,NEGATIVE
498,"Don’t Breathe was a film about a blind man who fights off a home invasion, well apparently some genius decided this movie needed a sequel. For anyone wondering I can safely tell you that Don’t Breathe did not need a sequel and there is absolutely no point in Don’t Breathe 2 at all. None. Set a few years following the home invasion, Norman Nordstrom (Stephen Lang) lives a quiet and isolated life until his past catches up to him. The first thing to note is Don’t Breathe 2 is rated 16 for a reason, the fight scenes are brutal and gory. But that’s about all it has going for it, the gore. I loved the first film but this doesn’t come close, not everything needs a sequel but it seems some films need to learn that lesson the hard way. This had none of the horror and suspense of the first film. You’re not on the edge of your seat holding your breath, you’ll instead find yourself slumped in your chair, bored and glancing at your watch waiting for this ordeal to be over. And in proper horror movie fashion you’ll think it’s finally over only to have an “oh wait it’s not quite over yet” moment. Taking Lang’s character and half-heartedly attempting to turn him into some sort of anti-hero did not work at all. Another issue is because most of you will remain disinterested and bored you can’t help but feel many of the injuries sustained by the main characters don’t stop them from getting back up again like cartoon characters and carrying on as if nothing happened. Yet the same or lesser injury will happen to a clearly disposable character only for it to be more than enough to keep them down or kill them. This is not the kind of thing I should have been thinking about or noticing but I couldn’t help it I was not invested in the film at all which left me with plenty of time to overthink everything. I’m not going to criticise the acting. It’s not their fault to be honest, they’re doing the best they can with what they were given. The film shouldn’t exist and the story doesn’t work on any level, there’s really no getting away from that. Don’t Breathe 2 is nothing more than a cash grab. I’m all for supporting cinemas especially during this difficult time but believe me when I tell you there are better films out right now that you should see instead. Not recommended, unless you’ve absolutely nothing else to do and you’ve seen all the other movies in the cinemas then by all means go ahead.",NEGATIVE

505,"Alright Nicolas Cage fans, this is the moment we’ve been waiting for. It’s 2021 and Pig is finally here, if you haven’t heard of this film until now where have you been? Rob the truffle hunter (Nicolas Cage) lives an isolated life deep in the Oregonian wilderness. He is forced to return to his past in Portland when his beloved truffle pig is stolen. Clearly Rob has a mysterious past and once he starts searching for his pig in the city he must face some past traumas. I don’t believe I’m alone in thinking Pig was going to be something along the lines of John Wick but with a pig. Despite the warnings Pig really isn’t the film you expect and that’s not a criticism. We all know Nicolas Cage has a wide range of performances, from exceptional to exceptionally terrible. You don’t always know what you’re going to get but Pig is without a doubt one of Cage’s best performances. It’s not full on Nicolas Cage (eg. Mandy) it’s a much more subtle performance and unexpectedly emotional. The story itself may seem a little slow at times and honestly I’m glad of its short running time as I don’t think it needed to be any longer. It carefully and quietly deals with themes of loss and death and honestly takes a lot of unexpected turns. It may not be for everyone so any of you expecting John Wick may want to skip this one. Pig is one of those films to remind us all why we should love Nicolas Cage. A certain cinema chain isn’t listing any showings for Pig surprise, surprise. So you may have to travel past your local cinema to see this one but don’t let that stop you. Highly recommended and a must see for all the Nicolas Cage fans.",POSITIVE

524,"It's truly disappointing when a film starts off with great potential but then squanders its viewer-earned goodwill as the story unfolds. So it is with director Lisa Joy's debut feature, a future noir offering that mixes sci-fi, romance and mystery in a blend that draws from films like ""Blade Runner,"" ""Brainstorm,"" ""Inception,"" ""Total Recall,"" ""Elysium"" and ""Deja Vu."" In a war-ravaged, environmentally degraded version of Miami in which depressed residents escape their troubles by recalling cherished memories thanks to sophisticated mind-tapping technology, a former Navy interrogator who runs a business providing this service finds himself caught up in a steamy romance with a mysterious femme fatale who suddenly disappears without a trace. But, in his attempt to locate her, he unwittingly finds himself caught up in a web of drug trafficking and corruption, circumstances that he would have been better off leaving alone. It's when the film turns from stylish romance to crime saga that the picture starts getting bogged down in too many plot tangents, underdeveloped story threads and conventionality, all of which undermine what this release had going for it at the outset. To be sure, the romantic and sci-fi elements of this story generally work well, but the more conventional aspects of the story intrude far too much, taking away from the overall viability of the production. The filmmaker shows promise with this debut, but future projects call for better judgment when it comes to determining what works and what doesn't.",NEGATIVE
525,"First off, this is basically a contemporary opera. Almost every moment is sung, featuring compositions by Sparks. The story is loaded with opera staples like desperate passion and inevitable despair. It’s set in modern LA, where Adam Driver plays a provocative conceptual comedian (never funny). His fervent romance with a world-renowned opera singer (Marion Cotillard) develops into marriage and a baby…that’s when things go bad. French director Leos Carax has infused the film with grand gestures, dramatic visuals and plentiful fervor. The performances are dynamic with Driver leading the pack with unapologetic commitment. The songs are primarily pop-based with plenty of catchy refrains (in the Sparks style). Comparisons to La La Land are inevitable, but this much more of an art film than a populist flick. Unquestionably unique. NOTE: Stay thru the credits for one final song/procession.",POSITIVE

The sole positive point, worthy of a '6' on my review, is Henry Goulding. Handsome and charismatic, he has a great screen presence and I was quite surprised that he was a complete acting newbie when he starred in Crazy Rich Asian. What a great find. Seeing this film, I imagined him a perfect candidate for another franchise, one whose main actor is having his last hurrah this October...James Bond. He is the perfect candidate for it.

One of the best supporting cast members on Veep, along with his co-starring role on Detroiters (nice timing that his buddy, Tim Robinson's Netflix sketch series just dropped it's second season), Richardson anchors this movie with his persona. Richardson plays a relocated forest ranger, assigned to the little snowy berg of Beaverfield. The first person he meets upon arriving is the mail carrier, portrayed by Milana Vayntrub, who is best known as AT&T's Lily. Sure, she is cute and quirky on those commercials, but given her performance in this movie, give this woman more movie roles. Their back-and-forth dialogue and chemistry is humorous and adorable. The tiny town is divided by the prospect of a gas pipeline, with some residents for it and some against. In the midst of this, the dead body of the husband of the owner of the local inn is found mauled to death. Then the power goes out. To steal another critic's line, it's as if John Carpenter's The Thing was mixed with the characters from Letterkenny. To say more would ruin the joy of this amusing comedy/horror hybrid. I'll just say ""heaven's to Betsy"", give it a watch.",POSITIVE

540,"Bon voyage, Streamers! Another weekend, another option from that media conglomerate Disney! The latest adaptation of Disneyland ride into a big budget movie is Jungle Cruise, premiering in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access. Disney had great success with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, which was maybe the first film adaptation of a theme park ride; and it was buoyed by spectacular effects including the daffy, virtuosic performance from Johnny Depp. Why not try again, right? In a sense, it would seem like a movie based on a theme park ride would need an over-the-top hook like a Depp performance to make it work, but Jungle Cruise has The Rock and Mary Poppins 2.0, so... Anyway, here's how Jungle Cruise fared in its waters. I've never been on the Jungle Cruise ride, so I have no idea if there is a storyline there. I'm going to assume there is not, so the screenwriters had to develop a plot to get the characters on an boat in the jungle and stuff happening. The basics of the plot are that Dr. Lily Houghton (Blunt), a brilliant and adventurous scientist ignored in the science community because she is a woman in the early 20th century, sets out to find an elusive tree with healing powers in the heart of the Amazon. Reluctantly accompanied by her younger brother, McGregor (Jack Whitehall), Lily determined with her wits and an ancient artifact believes she can locate the tree and survive the foray into the jungle. Lily and McGregor engage the services of a riverboat man, Frank (Johnson), who has secrets of his own, to get them deep into the jungle. All the while, mysterious strangers and nefarious villain lurk in the recesses of the jungle threatening to derail Lily's quest. Hijinks, puns, and CGI ensue. Look, the story is ridiculous, but it's a Disney movie. It reminds me of the quest to harness Vibranium from Blank Panther. Everything is so broad and vaguely sketched. The villains are evil for evil-sake - there's no definable motivation or characteristic, except that they are bad guys. It does take too long for the Lily, McGregor and Frank to get on the river and on with their quest. I can see a viewer getting a little bored about 20 minutes in. The movie does pick up when some cool special effects show up and inject some energy into the story. Once you get to that point, it should be smooth sailing to the end. On the positive side, Johnson and Blunt are a good big screen pair. They have good chemistry, even if the relationship is ridiculous. Blunt has that easy charm she carries in every role. She's believable as a plucky and headstrong scientist. It's easy to root for her. Johnson has charisma for days. Even though he is saddled with some groan-inducing one-liners and puns, he sells them the best he can and maintains his cool. I'll also shout out Jack Whitehall. He does a great job of keeping up with his superstar co-stars and even steals a scene or two. While I think the CGI is great, it overpowers anything from Edgar Ramirez and what's worse is that is steals from Pirates of the Caribbean without adding anything special. Nevertheless, the production design and magnificent set pieces are a great reason to see this movie. Jungle Cruise is a fun, summer Disney popcorn flick. It has issues with its plot and pacing early on, but it gains steam as it sails along. Blunt and Johnson do a great job of keeping the movie light and entertaining. Even though the story is ridiculous, you at least root for the characters and can get lost in the special effects, sets and costumes. I wouldn't run out to see Jungle Cruise, but a Saturday matinee with a bowl of popcorn, especially with the family, could be fun.",NEGATIVE

543,"This movie was marketed as a horror but it’s definitely more of an action/thriller flick. As such, it does a great job producing more than enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. For those critics who are too caught up with the fact that Norman is not redeemable based on his actions in the first movie and are arguing that this film doesn’t justify its existence, please just get over yourselves for a minute and listen up. This film is in no way trying to absolve Norman of his sins, or indicate that he’s a good guy, redeemed, a hero, or even an anti-hero. We all know that Norman is a terrible man, and just because he also recognizes this now does not make him good. The only character that shows affinity toward him is Phoenix, and that’s because it’s the only reality she understands. She is not privy to his past, and even so has a desire to leave him for a better life. Also, for anyone who believes any amount of redemption is not remotely possible, did you also hate American History X? If so, maybe it’s time to set your shiny moral compass aside, and realize there are OBJECTIVE ways to review movies too. Now, aside from the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed this film, if I look at things objectively, here are some observations: - Story line is unique but complimentary to the first film. Plenty of twists and turns that were unexpected. Despite the looming presence of Norman, overall this is a story about Phoenix’s experience navigating a world full of oppression, and selfish, terrible people. - Despite some cheesy lines, the acting was intense, solid, and believable. Props to Madelyn Grace for a tour de force breakout performance. - Cinematography was stellar, and added so much suspense to the story. The 6 minute long shot of Phoenix evading bad guys in the beginning was a definite highlight. At times the picture was too dark, but it also played well into the suspense. - Pacing started out slow, but worked effectively to build suspense. You know things are going to get intense, and when they finally do it’s a fun ride. - This is an action/thriller, but surprisingly has some elements of drama and humor as well. Overall, this was a solid directorial debut from Rodo Sayagues, and anyone who says it sucked because Fede Alvarez didn’t direct doesn’t understand the dynamic of this duo. They worked closely together as a creative team on both films, and in the immortal words of Fede, “I make films to piss you off.” Based on some of the troll-ish critic reviews out there, looks like they succeeded. Well done guys, great film!",POSITIVE

545,"So here we go again… fast and the furious… but the ninth one. But is it really the ninth one? I feel after fast 5, the series has been really stale and almost kind of lost it’s identity. Let me explain, since the fourth entry they kind of stepped away from the racing scene and more onto the action. What made fast and the furious so great were the cars, it’s racing, and of course bits of action and drama. However, every entry after tokyo drift suddenly took a quick right turn to more action than racing. Fast and furious (4) started it off with less racing and more action. This didn’t make it necessarily bad but sure wasn’t my favorite. It’s sequel Fast Five was fantastic even though there was pretty much no racing in the movie. Fast Five felt refreshing and more innovative to the series. Then came 6, 7, 8, and 9. Oh boy where do I begin?!? Thats right no where because the last 4 entries had basically no racing and ran off as a bootleg mission impossible series. Rip paul… but anyways here we are with fast 9 which is kind of a copy and paste of 7, 8, and 9 where nothing new and innovative was brought to the table. Dom starts movie off with family, world and family are in danger, family fights, family happy at end. Nothing new to the table and rather mindless action packed scenes. Don’t get me wrong, the action is fun to watch but once you get behind the fact that you’re watching a “fast and the furious” movie, you actually question yourself “why is it even called that in the first place”. In conclusion, f9 is played out as a spy/action-adventure movie where little to no racing was taken place. Original fans of the series like myself hoped for more racing like the first 3 movies but were left in disappointment with a movie that goes to space. Oh and did I forget to mention family?",NEGATIVE

The visual effects were spectacular. The acting was phenomenal especially from Ryan Reynolds, Jodie Comer, Channing Tatum, Taika Waititi, Lil Rel Howery, Joe Keery, and Utkarsh Ambudkar.

Yet, you get some spectacular views and designs in the background. The acting was in tone and convincing. The soundtrack was pretty bad all along the movie. Way too present in some sequences. Not the best from Newton-Howard. I did like the modern music parts, it was a break from the rest of the soundtrack. I give it 58%.

Even after being connected to big films that were never made, such as the adaptation of Halo, a hypothetical new installment of Alien with Sigourney Weaver leading, and a new RoboCop movie. He didn't do any of them. He's an ambitious director who has made interesting stories but has never managed to surpass his debut; District 9, and while Elysium and Chappie weren't really successful, neither of them had been as brutal a setback in his career as Demonic is, which is easily the worst film he's done so far, by far. Demonic has an interesting concept, but that's pretty much the only thing to be commended. The execution, the direction, the tone, the incredible lack of horror, and above all the bad performances end up closing the circle of a painful disappointment.",NEGATIVE
554,"Making a documentary about the COVID-19 pandemic has got to be one of the most challenging ventures a filmmaker can undertake, especially given the fact that it's still ongoing. What's more, there are so many aspects to focus on, that it's undoubtedly difficult to know where to place proper emphasis. And, when one adds to that the ever-shifting sands of available and credible information (particularly from officials in China, site of the pandemic's origin, and the US), it's difficult to know what to believe. Such are the hurdles that director Nanfu Wang faced in making this film, now airing on HBO. Certain elements are sensitively and expertly handled, such as the impact of the pandemic on victims, their families and the health care workers tending to their needs, painfully sad segments guaranteed to move viewers to tears. However, the slope is considerably slipperier when it comes to addressing governmental responses to the virus. Is the ineffectual handling of the crisis due to incompetence, a lack of preparation and/or blind denial, or is something more nefarious at work, given the hardline, authoritarian, propagandist proclamations that, arguably, are being issued on both sides of the globe? On this front, the director seems less sure of herself, hedging her bets and holding back from saying what she really wants to say. That's unfortunate given that Ms. Wang is generally not one to waffle, as previously seen in hard-hitting releases like ""One Child Nation."" Here, however, she seems to resist throwing down the gauntlet, an approach that dilutes her message -- and weakens the film -- at a time when a definitive perspective is needed more than ever.",NEGATIVE
555,"""Respect"" nos faz questionar porque diabos parece existir um grande espaço entre ""Dreamgirls"" até aqui na carreira de Jennifer Hudson. O que ela precisa para estar em grandes filmes? Mais um Oscar? Sua atuação é o que não te faz tirar os olhos de ""Respect"" nem por um segundo, mesmo que você tenha que ver transições não tão bem executadas, cenas desengonçadas e saídas fáceis do roteiro. Porém, quando Jennifer abre a boca é como uma borracha que quase apaga tudo de irregular que você viu. E, claro, Forest Whitaker também está ótimo. Quero essa dupla na próxima temporada de premiações, viu!",NEGATIVE

560,"A great cinematography to support a boring and cheesy story. The fight scenes are a big miss, not filmed properly but much more like a drama instead of dynamic moves and closer frames. The project is not bold enough and some risks should have been taken considering the futuristic semi-post apocalyptic context where the overall mood is too sanitized and proper. The bad guy character played by Daniel Wu is out of subject, limit hilarious, and should have been replaced by Sam Medina who has much more charisma and fits the part perfectly. Overall, we feel the Nolan family influence and understand a directing job and deal were given by relationship and political context of diversity and inclusion… which excludes prioritizing talent which is common mistake by studios nowadays. A huge budget for a deception at its level.",NEGATIVE
561,"Mediocre in every way apart from some of the fighting choreography. Main guy has no charisma, I understand you needed someone who knows martial arts, but it aint to tony stark, thats for sure.

562,"Jungle Cruise was a very pleasant surprise for me after hearing a lot of the reviews from critics. For most it seems this movie is very mixed, but I absolutely enjoyed myself. For me Jungle Cruise harkened back to movies like Indiana Jones and The Mummy (no, not the Tom Cruise one), and that is a huge complement. Johnson and Blunt are absolutely fabulous and the supporting cast is a lot of fun too. Was it as good as the first Pirates of the Caribbean film? No, but it also wasn’t as disappointing as The Haunted Mansion either. They could easily turn this into a franchise and I’m absolutely all in for it. If you want a whimsical adventure movie meant for the whole family, this is a good one to watch.",POSITIVE

566,The only thing I can think is we are going through a period where the studios are holding back on a lot of the better movies and releasing movies that were meant originally for streaming. I'm really surprised this was in the theaters. I just was not scary at all. I really liked the original and this one looked like it might be cool from the trailer. But I just didn't like it at all. Very disappointed.,NEGATIVE
567,If you watch this for story of course most of it is quite bs. It is basically popcorn movie and need to watch it for action - I rate it based on how good action was and I think since the budget is high then action in it also was quite good,POSITIVE
568,"I just watched Jungle Cruise. It was entertaining and funny enough to hold your interest. The acting from Emily Blunt and The Rock was good. Average Disney movie felt inspired by Pirates of the Caribbean. Was it as good as Pirates of the Caribbean, no, better than the last two, but still a decent and enjoyable movie. I'd give it an 8.0/10.",POSITIVE
569,"You’ve got to be braindead to think this is even a remotely decent piece of work… The script feels like it was written by someone who’s had zero human interaction in their lifetime, and when the characters deliver their lines, it feels like they’re reading them straight from the page for the first time. Altogether, it feels like a first draft error among all aspects that bring a film to life. The acting’s atrocious, the writing’s god-awful, the setting and beating sun wear out its welcome all too fast, and not one single event seems to unfold in a natural or convincing way. I felt a sense of relief that the end runtime was getting closer with each character’s passing.",NEGATIVE

Obviously this movie isn’t going to win any awards or anything but it’s not trying too and personally it’s the most fun I’ve had watching a movie in years. If you wanna kick back and have some fun at the theatre this is definitely the movie to see.,POSITIVE
572,"Неплохой развлекательный фильм, который забываешь сразу же после выхода из кинотеатра, кроме великолепной песни Mariah Carey ""Fantasy"". К сюжету претензий нет, но во-первых фильм жутко портит наш русский дубляж, во-вторых снова видеть Райана Рейнольдса в роли DeadPool порядком надоело, то ли он боится перевоплотится, то ли ему агенты запретили экспериментировать и в итоге меня не покидало ощущение, что смотрю к сожалению фильм под названием ""DeadPoll 3: Free Guy""",NEGATIVE
573,"I was genuinely excited to see a slasher/horror movie with an all African American cast, director, and writer. I didn't know it was just going to be about how much white people suck. Not that racial relations aren't important to discuss, but... I dunno, this seemed like it was far more interested in that than making a good horror film. To be clear, I am all for diversity and inclusion. But I'm not sure this is the way to do it. Looked good, acting was good all around.",NEGATIVE

575,"A number of documentaries have been released to mark the 20th anniversary of 9/11, but this is a fact-based drama that tackles a unique angle. Michael Keaton creates an involving performance as Kenneth Feinberg, who was assigned the contentious and unenviable task of compensating the families of the attacks. Much of the story involves efforts to cope with the variations on the basic rules, with 2 cases highlighted for a more personal aspect. While there are numerous testimonies about the effect that day, these grueling accounts seldom spark any emotion. The filmmakers alternate between the strategic political machinations and the complex human angles. Even though it lacks the emotional punch you’d expect from this subject, the film proves a fascinating look into this specific outcome from that terrible event.",POSITIVE

578,"The tone of this movie skirts the line of campy really hard, but balances itself out well with moments of seriousness and good scares. The film is loaded with twists, and is a fun ride all the way to the end. The acting can come off as kind of flat at times, but that appears to be by design rather than an oversight. A long overdue dose of escapism overall that is at least worth a watch.",POSITIVE
579,"Jungle Cruise it's an adventure that feels like the old classic Disney, but that at the same time is positive and negative. Positive for the fantasy aura, negative because it doesn't feel like anything is at stake. It offers basically the same kind of entertainment you'd expect from the park ride.",POSITIVE
580,"Shang-Chi was a fun movie. The story is mystical in nature, in line with Dr Strange. It has a lot of humour and great actions/fighting. The acting was very solid from the main actors to the secondaries. The CGI was solid too. The fighting sequence was really good, except for the one on the tower exterior, where it gets too fast and confusing. The music support the movie very well. I give it 82%. I really like it, especially since I never even read one comic about that character. It was all new to me and very enjoyable.",POSITIVE

I loved this movie.The Mael brothers are eccentric, and yet quite normal. Their self -depracating humor shines through in this movie. I think it's that humor that bonds these two brothers to continue making music to this day. I am so glad I took a chance on learning more on why the ""Sparks Brothers' are able to take a licking and keep on ticking close to 50 years on in their fascinating career.

As an Aretha fan, I appreciated the LIVE music and vocals. Thank you Liesel Tommy for truly honoring our Queen’s legacy.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",POSITIVE
585,"Es definitivamente una película de James Wan, de principio a fin, es bastante gráfica y es muy entretenida, el problema no es el ritmo ni los personajes, mucho menos la banda sonora, el problema es que hay un revoltijo de géneros cinematográficos que nunca terminan de cuajar, empieza con suspenso, luego terror sobrenatural, luego slasher con toques de giallo y finalmente acción desenfrenada con masacre incluida. Lo giros de trama funcionan solo por cumplir pero nada del otro mundo, en general es una buena película, quizás decepcione a muchos debido a la enorme ausencia de sustos de todo tipo y un final simplón e incipido.",NEGATIVE
586,"The fight scenes were well choreographed and stylish leaving me at the edge of my seat with every set piece fight/battle. I've noticed that there are people on here reviewing extremely negatively based on single elements, which I don't understand. I loved the performances from the entire cast. All around fun movie to watch.",POSITIVE
587,"I watched the film, but it didn't appeal to me as much as the prior films. The change in theme and concept was one of the things that bothered me the most in this film. From street racing and minor crimes, the movies evolved into an idea of saving the planet. Okay, that's wonderful; you can save the world; however, how can someone reach space in his car and survive? Seriously? I don't recall this being fast and furious. The plot was similar to earlier films and revolved around Hobbs and Shaw. The story was not exceptional in any way. And, when it comes to action, it was unrealistic and unbelievable. Thousands of cars followed Dom's crew, and thousands of guys with bullets and automatic weapons fired at them, but nothing happened to them. No one was hurt in any way. Are they immortals? I felt the absence of screenwriter Chris Morgan as the structure and storytelling were sloppier to the overall detriment of the film.",NEGATIVE
588,This movie is great the story the action en the end it's amazing best movie in years,POSITIVE

591,"Less than halfway through the movie it's impossible to not know how it ends unless you lack basic lateral thinking abilities. The ending explicitly stated that Candyman only murders guilty white folk (girls bullying a black girl, racist cops) except 20 minutes before the end they shoe horned in a 30 second clip of Candyman murdering two little black girls so the entire movie isn't about killing whitey. So retarded. Wouldn't be surprised if this movie was produced by BLM.",NEGATIVE

594,"Allegedly, ""Eternals"" is on the table to be delayed if ""Shang-Chi” under-performs... Welp, they better get that idea off the table ASAP, because this movie is not only doing amazingly well, it's also an amazing movie! “Shang-Chi” is a unique genre blend of martial arts, fantasy, and family drama. In my opinion, this film had quite possibly, some of the best fights in any Marvel movie. The film had everything you could possibly want in a martial arts film: From elegant ""Wire fu"" fights to traditional martial arts to feudal battles, it was a true celebration of Asian martial arts. Coupled with amazing martial arts, this film also had a fun fantasy element to it: The second half of the movie was filled to the brim with Asian folklore creatures and enough whimsy to fill your heart with wonder and awe. If there was anything I’d fault the movie for, it would be the high budget visual effects sort of “deluding” some of the martial arts scenes and maybe a bit too much forced humor. It just feels like every Marvel movie HAS to be a comedy these days, and I hope that trend simmers down in the future. “Shang-Chi” was a pleasant surprise and a HUGE win for the “Marvel Cinematic Universe.” ""Ant-Man,"" I love ya... But ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has officially taken your spot in my ""Top 5 Marvel Movies"" List!",POSITIVE

596,"Wasn't as bad as the rest of them honestly ,I mean I still preferred it when it was about racing then this crap but it was still alright ,story was somehow important to the saga and John Cena did pretty good as Dom's younger brother. Sung Kang is one of my favorite actors so I think this helped and end credits has a nice little set up.",POSITIVE
597,"Brothers/bandmates Ron and Russell Mael have been recording and playing around the world since 1967, but many people (myself included) have never heard of them. This doc features the duo in a “formal” studio interview, as well as numerous musicians who’ve been involved with or influenced by them. There’s also a lot of stills and footage detailing most of their output. Surprisingly, they’ve been prolific and popular all this time and this is an entertaining way to discover them. The only complaint (even the 2:15 running time didn’t get tiresome) is that there’s almost no insight into their personal life. It’s a quirky movie that echoes Sparks’s eccentric style by showcasing their fascinating and innovative creative output.",POSITIVE
598,"On the one hand, there's the consistently questionable dialogue, the spotty performance work throughout and the overall clumsiness in handling certain nuts and bolts in the narrative. On the other hand, though, there's James Wan's always dynamic directorial bravado on display, the generally engrossing mystery at the center of things...and the absolutely batty third act that's just impossible not to enjoy. I hate to parrot the masses with this stale of a take here, but they really are correct - the final twenty minutes of this movie really do make it worth the watch. It's just always a blast to see a film and filmmaker make such a balls-to-the-wall, wacky-ass decision and have it pay off with so much raw entertainment value. Can definitely say with confidence that this is something I've never seen before and I for sure do not regret doing so.",POSITIVE
599,"Its Indiana Jones for kids and my kids liked it a lot. Jungle Cruise has its moments and both Emily Blunt and DJ does a good job. Effects are ok, jokes are ok, story is ok and overall it is well worth seeing especially if you include your teenagers.",POSITIVE

601,The first movie since Conjuring (2013) what made me scream like a baby. Amazing job!,POSITIVE
602,"Predictable. Watched this as I know that Jodie Comer is a fantastic actor and even she managed to let me down a few times when her accent slipped. She could have chosen a much better movie for her Hollywood debut. The plot was predictable from the moment it was revealed that Guy had a crush on Millie and that the other dude who's in stranger things programmed him. Ridiculous hetero normative nonsense. I didn't laugh at all during the course of the movie, the good jokes were all in the adverts. Predicatbale, cliche, 'love will save us all' plot line, could have had a more philosophical air to it about the reality of artificial intelligence even but chose to focus on fortnite dances and cheap hits. DO not watch this movie if you're over the age of 8. Unlike movies such as shrek, this is not universal.",NEGATIVE
603,"This movie is fine. Not great, not bad, and fun enough for what it is. It`s nice to see genuine and fun movies like this again, even if it doesn`t match the charm and wit of its obvious inspirations like ""The Mummy"". I`d argue the film is hurt a bit by its over-realiance on CGI, as it does hurt the sense of exploration and discovery that`s a big part of these movies.",POSITIVE
604,"This is not snake eyes, if you go on the lore. In the lore snake eyes is a white male how doesn´t speak, he wheres a mask to cover massive scars on his face. This is just a white man bad switcheroo to virtue signaling.",NEGATIVE

606,"Sundrenched yet dark, Summer of 85 is a gorgeously shot French film with a great retro soundtrack (notably featuring The Cure’s “In Between Days”). Aside from its technical brilliance, it’s a moving, well-acted queer story. Highly recommend this excellent selection from Cannes!",POSITIVE
607,"This has the best fight choreography in an MCU movie since Captain America Winter Solider. The story was pretty good and the acting was on point, the cameos from a few characters were really cool to see as well. Overall the fight scenes were the star of the movie and the story was good, I’d definitely recommend it especially if you like good martial arts fight scenes.",POSITIVE
608,"I’m not sure how I caught the trailer for this movie, but I remember that it made me curious. I checked to see if it was playing on demand and I saw that it was on sale for a low price so I thought I’d give it a shot. I’m very glad I did. It was absolutely engrossing in its plot and utterly stunning in its visuals. While the story is very familiar, it was beautifully set amongst the post-apocalyptic fallout of a total global catastrophe and is told in an unbelievably fresh and comprehensive way. There’s almost a “Water World” vibe here, but it’s paced better with relatively little dialog. You can see where the story is driving to for the most part, but that destination was compelling and a thrilling pleasure to watch unfold. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve read or discussed aspects about a film’s cinematography, but ultimately I could only really tell you wether it was good or not. There were several instances while watching this that I legitimately couldn’t tell how they got a shot. Because of that I will likely be viewing this again soon. The acting and actors are just outstanding and it felt like they were really a part of the world being shown. Along with this, the score too was very well done and not intrusively weighing any of the scenes down. While at times it can be a bit of a downer, if you are at all a Sci-Fi fan you should definitely check this out.",POSITIVE
609,"A popcorn entertainment movie that gets worse and worse the more you think about it. I went into this cautiously optimistic and came out feeling underwhelmed and bored. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt are fine. Their chemistry works sometimes and feels really awkward at others but their script doesn’t help. The script leaves a lot to be desired along with the runtime leaves me feeling bored. I found myself checking my watch a lot during the second act because I just didn’t care about the characters or what they were doing. The plot tends to take a backseat to explain the backstory of the villains and The Rock’s characters but I don’t really care about the villains or The Rock’s character. There are two villains in this film and while one is completely forgettable the other is only held up by Jesse Plemon’s engaging and energetic performance. His character sucks but he definitely helps keep me interested. The action started out fun but got bland and WAY too over reliant on CGI which at points looks really bad. The music felt really bland at points but they have a instrumental rendition of Metallica’s Nothing Else Matters which was cool to hear. Towards the end of the film, Emily Blunt’s character makes a really awful decision that contradicts what her character wanted and what The Rock’s character wanted. As it deals with the end of the film, I won’t spoil it but I was very annoyed by it. If you want a turn your brain off kind of movie then this would be perfect for you although don’t expect a lot.",NEGATIVE
610,"This is one edgy pop-horror movie, James Wan style. It's starts of a bit cheasy in the dialogue (a shame) but the actual plot, unraveling, cinematography and action is stupid cool and more refreshing that a Xth spin-off of the conjuring. People with taste and culture (especially in the particular genre that is horror) will appreciate this movie while other people may prefer more boring, classical and unoriginal one, but it was definitely a cool surprise that I didn't not expect.",POSITIVE
611,"After dipping his toe in big budget films in the Fast And Furious franchise and the DC universe, James Wan returns to his pulpy-Leigh Whannell partnered roots with Malignant. It's more along the lines of, say, Dead Silence than Saw. I've seen reviews mention the campy aspects of the film and I'd call it pulpy instead. Like Tales From The Crypt or Amazing Stories kind of pulpy. And the title which I kept mistaking as Malicious or Malficient, makes perfect sense as the precise definition of malignant is ""tending to invade normal tissue or to recur after removal"". Then there's the underground Seattle location with the building atop the damaged portion of the city that remains pretty much intact. Thematically fits. It's bat turd crazy, but in a good way. I've also seen comparisons to directors like DePalma and Raimi. I would add to the list, thematically, Frank Henenlotter of Basket Case and Brain Damage fame. That should give you an idea of what type of film Wan was aiming for.",POSITIVE
612,"I find this guy's story extremely dubious. There's just no evidence other than his account that any of this happened. Even the parents seem nutty. A lot of conjecture from people who have an agenda, and that agenda is a conspiracy documentary to clear their son of child porn charges. Who do I trust the least in this scenario? The guy running secret servers peddling classified info who's first reaction to an FBI inquiry is to go to the Russian or Venezuelan Embassy. Paranoia is a helluva drug.",NEGATIVE
613,"(Mauro Lanari) ""Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world, where none suffered, where everyone would be happy? It was a disaster. No one would accept the program, entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world, but I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this, the peak of your civilization."" Once this speech has been enunciated by Agent Smith, Neo's sense of heroism and the whole saga fades, but it is not easy to realize it, even after years: the problem lies not in the external constraints to us, but in the internal ones.

Watch this film soon...you'll be glad you did. Peace Out!",POSITIVE
615,"Oh my goodness this movie is AMAZING and everything about this movie is PERFECT. The chemistry between Audra McDonald and Skye Dakota Turner was amazing and it was so beautiful to see the chemistry being carried on later in the film with Audra and Jennifer Hudson. Despite only sharing one scene, they made it feel like they've known eachother their whole lives and they share a true mother-daughter relationship. Watching Forest Whitaker and Jennifer and even seeing the bond that Aretha and her sisters had was so beautiful. I was completely captivated by the movie that my eyes were just glued to the screen! Watching Aretha's development was so special because we see her starting out as timid but later, we see her discovering her voice and realizing that she's got this. Seeing that scene where Aretha was done with Ted for the last time and when it cut to her singing ""Think"", it was really a testament to her development. The movie was a huge reality check for me because it made me realize that Aretha had her demons and was human just like the rest of us. At times, it was really cool to realize that the movie was an actual movie because I felt so immersed in Ms Franklin's life that I felt like I was actually there. There were many scenes where I was on the brink of tears and one of the best scenes throughout the movie was the Amazing Grace scene. It was so emotional seeing Aretha surrounded by everyone closest to her while she sung what she wanted to sing. Seeing Tituss Burgess as Reverend James Cleveland interacting with Aretha really packed a huge punch because of their bond. It goes without saying that the music and singing was perfect, and to see how Aretha's mind would always be thinking about music really showed her artistry. No matter how small the role, you can definitely see the blood, sweat and tears put into the making of this film and Liesl Tommy REALLY outdid herself by directing this movie so magically. Thank you to everyone involved in the making of this film, from the prop team to the set makers and to the actors themselves. You've depicted the Queen's life so wonderfully and I look forward to watching this classic a 100 more times in the future and listening to the soundtrack for evermore.",POSITIVE
616,"The latest from writer/director Paul Schrader (of course best known for penning the screenplays for 'Taxi Driver' and 'Raging Bull), sees Oscar Isaac as a man drifting from casino to casino playing his hand and counting cards as a means of escape from his troubled past that he can't quite seem to let go of. While this isn't the high stakes gambling thriller that you might expect, what we get instead is a slow burn yet rather fascinating character study from Isaac who gives an always reliably great performance here, along with great support from fellow actors Tiffany Haddish, Tye Sheridan, and Willem Dafoe. The writing and conversations are sharp and crisp, which is what really kept me invested throughout more than anything. And while the story may feel a little abstract at times, the performances and writing are what really make this one worth the watch. Overall, it's not quite as harrowing or thought-provoking as Schrader's previous film 'First Reformed', but it still further solidifies him as one of the most thoughtful and insightful screenwriters in the business",POSITIVE
617,"Forever Purge was a great movie spoke a lot on topics that are happening in our nation. The story was great, The kills were trash ;The purge has a play book and it’s all Gun shoots. A night where people can legally kill people you know someone is gonna pull some Jigsaw Trap nonsense. The movie compared to the other Purge’s this is a 10/10. The movie was well shot and the ending was great, showing that the Purge and NFFA destroyed themselves by not listening to their people and country. I sincerely hope that they don’t make another purge as this is the perfect ending for the Purge Series. The Country caused its own down fall. Simple and Poetic. Spoke alot on Poor and Rich classes which was Interesting to see how the Classes are effected during a night of Legalized Crime. Also, nice to see how Racist spend the night of the purge and then seeing said Racist get their Brain Splattered. The Forever Purge needs to be the Final Purge. They need to work on making More interesting kills for this Series. Give the Audience a sense of true Crime and how horrible Humans can be Movie gets a 7/10 Out of all the Purge Moive’s it’s a 10/10",POSITIVE
618,"The movie starts off great in the first hour, but completely falls apart in the second hour due to a messy, convoluted plot involving way more characters than it needed.",NEGATIVE
619,"the story is awesome, we see a man struggling to get revenge and at the same time trying to find a meaning for his life, the story is balanced and well put out the graphics and the cinematography is top-notch i was having a smile the whole time but the only bad thing i saw is the ending conversations in the last 15min some actors seem abit fake or rushed maybe i don't know but i enjoyed the film",POSITIVE
620,"Este film es una buena pelicula y entrenedida para pasar el rato porque a eso se va al cine, es es el sentido de todo esto y esta pelicula te desconecta te hace pensar muchas cosas de como pudiera avanzar esta historia y como te van arreglando unos que otras cosas de la trama y eso es evolucion, una parodia total pero es mejor que la numero 8 lo que faltaron mas actores de peso, pero es algo distinto y dan oportunidades a otros personajes, lo que no parece bien es la publicidad y en el trailer que praticamente cuentan la pelicul",NEGATIVE
621,Just incompetently directed. CGI looked absurdly fake. Dialogue was vaguely amusing at some points but otherwise some mix of forgettable and try-too-hard. The reviews that mention this movie trying to be the mummy are on point. That's all I could think of while watching this. It's trying the whole movie. It never does or is anything of its own.,NEGATIVE
622,"This version was “authorized” by Franklin, who blessed Jennifer Hudson for the title role. There are similarities and vast differences in this 2:30 version vs. the National Geographic series Genius: Aretha. That one spent more time on the early gospel circuit, while this one just references it, along with virtually no mention of the years after the LP/movie Amazing Grace. That’s because the NatGeo project was produced by Clive Barnes, who apparently saved those records for his series. After moving from her childhood (featuring spectacular vocals from Skye Dakota Turner), this movie follows Franklin as she rises to fame. Those sequences are like a concert with Hudson singing Franklin’s early hits almost back to back. The singer’s troubled personal life is chronicled with extended segments dragging down the pace. Of course, Hudson nails the songs with power and her dramatic segments are her strongest work yet. Forest Whitaker (as her father) is OK, while Audra McDonald (as the mother) makes a magnificent impression in her brief scenes. Anyone looking to learn more about this icon will certainly find new information, but as a dramatic experience, the film is a ""respectable"" biopic.",POSITIVE
623,Feels like a movie filmed during a pandemic where a bunch of actors came together with a prized director because there was nothing else to do. The casting of A list actors to play two weasels in Detroit makes zero sense. At least in a movie like uncut gems Sandler felt like he could be that guy. The whole movie just feels forced and never reaches entertaining at any point. I was so bored that the sight of Matt Damon randomly was the most interesting thing that happened. John Hamm wearing a suit was more interesting than most of this movie.,NEGATIVE
624,The stunts were entertaining. I'll just leave it at that. I hope the stunt co-ordinators were paid very well. And I've seen far worse movies than F9. I saw Bill & Ted Face the Music in 2020.,NEGATIVE

627,"Finally got around to watching Jungle Cruise and I honestly wish I hadn't. This movie did something few other movies have ever done: It made me resent the time it was wasting WHILE I was still watching it. About a third of the way in, I was already checking out but we had spent the money so I decided to keep suffering through. By the end of the film I was angry at the film for wasting my time, angry at myself for falling victim to the sunk cost fallacy, and dumber for having sat through the entire thing. The plot is nonsensical even by ""Disney themepark rides turned movie"" standards, the runtime is far too long, there's zero feeling of tension or suspense thanks to the constantly bad CGI and cringe dialog. The movie is replete with direct ripoffs of Indiana Jones, The Mummy, the first Jumanji movie, and even Pirates of the Caribbean. The movie doesn't even establish a consistent villain opting, instead, to provide us with two-and-a-half of them: Jesse Plemons' ""Prince Joachim"", Edgar Ramirez's ""Aguirre"", and an utterly wasted Paul Giamatti as ""Nilo Nemolato"", a brief foil to Dwayne Johnson's ""Frank"". So many of the professional reviews say Johnson and Blunt saved this movie but I found them to be the two biggest annoyances in the entire thing. Dwayne Johnson doesn't know what role he's trying to play here -- is he playing the strong guy, the leading man guy, the comedic guy? He tries playing all of the above. His performance is so bad that if you compare it to his other work, films like San Andreas suddenly seem Oscar-worthy. And Emily Blunt's talents are completely and utterly wasted here. Blunt, who elevated lesser movies like Looper and Edge of Tomorrow, who played a fantastic Mary Poppins despite the doubters, and whose range was showcased in both A Quiet Place films was little more than a cheap knockoff of Rachael Wiesz's ""Evie"" from the Mummy. These same reviews praise their on screen chemistry... What chemistry? All they had were bad jokes. There was no Indiana/Marion or Rick/Evie chemistry in this film compared to Indiana Jones or The Mummy, respectively. Hell, the romantic subplots of the made-for-TV ""The Librarian"" movies with Noah Wyle have more chemistry. 1 out of 10, and I'm being generous here. A complete waste of time and space and not deserving of being associated with the word ""cinema"". Complete trash, avoid like the plague. There are literally dozens of better options within the same genre than this tripe.",NEGATIVE

633,"I see now that the whole documentary thing has been very controversial with some people, but I really dig into it. I mean, the fictional stuff may be seen as a dramatization after the blending comes; nonetheless, what Heidi Ewing has found here resonates on so many levels. We can't even begin to imagine how many families and relationships have been broken by the strict immigration rules. Armando Espitia and Christian Vázquez give two fine performances; you can really feel the struggle of being apart, especially from Espitia's character. And Vázquez is not that far behind. This is a great improvement from him since 'Leona.' The directing, of course, is key. The way Ewing — a U.S.-born director — captured the Mexican idiosyncrasy was a very nice surprise.",POSITIVE

640,"The film Malignant immediately caught my attention with its opening. There is quite a long period of incomprehension afterwards, but gradually various information starts to be revealed, which makes everything start to make more sense, until we actually get to see some of the revelations. I think it worked. Wan's style was on full display here. At one point I felt like I was watching The Conjuring. One minute I felt like I was watching Insidious and one minute I felt like I was watching Dead Silence. At one point I was even reminded of the Saw series. I just think Malignant is such a mix, and it fit me. I'd also like to highlight the music, which was really cool. For me, it's a good movie that I can recommend.",POSITIVE
641,Overall the film was very solid. Night seems to be returning to his original form. The twist worked for me and I know for some it won’t. But with that said still everything about this film kept me engaged and thinking the entire time. The beach was truly a horrifying entity.,POSITIVE

643,"He catches hell for selling out and starring in anything, but when Cage picks a great script and director, magic can happen. Presto.",POSITIVE
644,"The mysterious element in the personality of the Snake Eyes was missing, it seemed like an anomaly in how I always pictured Snake Eyes. The Snake Eyes of this movie was almost witty, is this how Snake Eyes is supposed to be? Particularly bothersome was the sudden change in the personality of Tommy (AKA Storm Shadow); he was very frank and carefree then all of a sudden after Snake Eyes saves him he becomes all serious and rigged. I was taken aback for a second like 'is he the same guy?'. Another thing which I noticed was that the animosity Snake Eyes had for COBRA, why was he willing to work with Baroness at the end, I mean how did he even have the appetite to do it. The main question to be asked is, Snake eyes never received any formal ninja/stealth training then how was he able to infiltrate the safe to steal the Jewel, I mean I get it he was a tough street fighter but his style was very crude this task should have been impossible. There are many other questions which could be raised for example how was Snake Eyes so well aware of the directions in a city which was all very new to him. I must say that this movie reminded me of Kill Bill and I must say there was very little blood-spill for a movie with a lot of assassins but this point is understandable. .Overall the acting was mediocre, Henry Golding as Snake Eyes was also not too bad. Haruka Abe as Akkiko was superb. In conclusion I would say that acting was better than writing/directing.",NEGATIVE
645,"Cage is phenomenal in this movie. So much emotion and so subtle that his performance makes the entire movie work. As a twist on the ""revenge for my pet"" story this makes a lot of unique turns and eventually goes on a rabbit hole you were not expecting. All the supporting actors do a great job in this. The plot is very emotional and very personal. Great film. I want more of this from Cage.",POSITIVE
646,"A big weekend hit the theater this past freaky Friday. We have the pleasure of reviewing Free Guy. A movie that drove me crazy in the theaters in the big media push last year finally has made it’s way to the big screen. Free Guy stars Ryan Reynolds as a video game bank teller that discovers that he’s actually a non-playable character inside a brutal video game. Blue Shirt Guy feels he’s destined for more but let’s see what he becomes. Ok, let’s get this out of the way – this movie at PG-13 is so darn cute. It is such a far step from Deadpool or The Hitman’s Bodyguard‘s raunchiness that I forgot that Ryan Reynolds could do a witty comedy without a potty mouth. I wish he’d go back to days of comedies like The Proposal. What a classic! Anyway, the storylines in the film just make you want to say “awwww” by the end of the movie. We have a coming of age, emancipation, and a love story all wrapped in one. Yet, all of it is a new age gamer’s delight. The CGI and animation are similar to many of the worlds of GTA, Fortnite, Roblox and others, which makes this movie very fun. Gamers will definitely watch this flick and say I’ve definitely done those exact things over the years and it just makes you feel good. Other than the gaming nostalgia, the movie just feels lighthearted and makes you feel good. Nevertheless, the same things that make this movie enjoyable also make it slightly corny, annoying or unoriginal. The comedy through the movie is good, only a few hard laughs but at least, it keeps you chuckling throughout. That chuckle that’s like, “this is a bit corny but cute” *giggle*; or, Ryan’s doing this shtick again but without cursing, *yawn*; or I like you Taika but this is a bit much. On top of that, aside from the cuteness, it feels “been there, done that”. In fact, I found myself saying is this just Ready Player One with just new age games? Unfortunately, it does feel like that movie mixed with other unrequited love stories. That’s saying too much but it won’t hurt you’re viewing pleasure anyway. Either way, the cast does a good job as a whole even if they didn’t have much to work with. With that said, Shawn Levy, Ryan Reynolds and gang did an great job giving us this Free City world. Free Guy is the type of movie that makes you say, “Aww that was nice” but doesn’t knock your socks off. The plot and writing are a bit obvious and cliché but the overall feel of the movie is so cute. I think this movie speaks more to the young gamer community looking to find their place in the world; but if you are looking for a nice lighthearted comedy, especially if you’re a gamer, check out Free Guy with bowl of popcorn. This is a matinee, family friendly dream.",POSITIVE
647,"I found the movie very enjoyable to watch. The action sequences were among the best in the MCU, the CGI elements were really pretty and there were some really hilarious parts. Some of the characters had really fascinating stories that were nice to see. The Chinese legends elements didn’t resonate that well to me but were well executed and didn’t affect the viewing experience negatively. Something was missing to me in the development of some characters but hard to go into details without spoiling. Definitely a great movie that I can wholeheartedly recommend people to watch. I’m a fan of MCU but I have zero interest in Marvel comics. I am also a white guy from Finland in case it matters to anyone.",POSITIVE

649,"Adequately expressing the expansive nature of existence in all its various permutations is far from an easy feat in any artistic milieu. But director Edson Oda has done a more than commendable job in his debut feature about an other-dimensional case worker who spends nine days interviewing aspirants to fill a vacancy that's become open in physical reality. It's an experience that tests the character of the candidates, as well as that of the interviewer himself, a once-incarnate being who has mixed feelings about his corporeal existence (and has no apparent desire to return to it). The narrative thus provides viewers with a metaphysical tango in which facilitator and students end up becoming mirrors of one another and where they unwittingly switch roles in teaching and learning life lessons, no matter what reality those instructions may ultimately be applied to. While the narrative is occasionally a little too elusive for its own good, all is gradually and eventually revealed, making for an exceedingly thought-provoking cinematic and philosophical experience. The picture's minimalist but inventive production design, innovative editing and fine performances (particularly those of Independent Spirit Award nominee Benedict Wong and protagonist Winston Duke, who reveals acting chops most viewers probably never realized he possessed) combine for an intriguing and insightful tale, one that will have audience members talking about at length afterward. This little-known indie gem is a must-see for those who appreciate cinema that's both entertaining and enlightening and who like to leave the theater with something to ponder long after the flickering on the screen stops.",POSITIVE
650,Possibly the worst movie I have seen people even got up and left mid movie in the cinema I was in,NEGATIVE
651,"This movie is so touching and heartfelt that I can't even put into words what I felt when I was watching. I've cried many time over certain scenes; more than with your regular movie where you cry once, at the end and that's it. The message is incredible and even though you might not be going through something similar, you will feel it in your core. More attention needs to be placed in this community because this is not the only family going though hardships.",POSITIVE

654,The movie is full of holes and issues. The whimsical direction this took just wasn’t what I expected. It could have shined if it had been more serious. It could have been better with better casting screenwriting and a more serious tone. I always question casting The Rock in any movie because he is a comedy kind of actor. Which worked I guess in this show. It just needs to be redone but with different screenwriters and a different director next time.,NEGATIVE

Especially on a big screen. But… F9 is just ridiculous. Not only does it jump the shark, it body slams it, kills it, brings it back to life, and then does it all over again. Sure, it’s fun. And I would be lying if I didn’t say I enjoyed myself. BUT, this franchise has officially left behind what made Fast+Furious and Fast Five so wonderful. I won’t say it’s not worth seeing.

660,"Disney’s movie version of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride made big money, so they’re going for gold with this classic attraction. Dwayne Johnson plays the wise cracking captain who’s hired by an intrepid researcher (Emily Blunt) to seek a magical tree with special healing powers deep in the Amazon. The supernatural forces and human heavies they encounter provide action beats. Unfortunately, (like so many current films) the staging and editing are so jumbled that much of it is a blur. Still, the pace never lags and there are sufficient scrapes to keep it rolling. Of course, the ""opposites attract"" chemistry between the leads is OK with Johnson landing numerous corny jokes and Blunt looking resplendent (even after going thru much grubby activity). To add comic fun is Jack Whitehall, as her prissy brother (not a stretch for the actor) and kudus to Disney for letting him be semi-subtly gay. Overall, this is about as much fun as the ride, only 2 hours longer, so families should find sufficient entertainment. Even so, this isn’t as big a score as the Pirates series.",NEGATIVE

I'm confused by people saying it left the fear behind cause the first one wasn't scary either lol. It's basically how the quiet place 1 and 2 went from thriller to action. This did the same thing. Ya have to watch it, really good.",POSITIVE
663,It's a great film. Not sure why all the reviews are being so negative towards it.,POSITIVE
664,"Peele's first miss for me. Your typical SJW movie executed poorly imo. There isn't much of a story just the ""boogeyman"" all throughout. It can be summed up as your girlfriend or wife rambling on about something, in the middle of it you're like oh she might have a point, but by the time she's done you realize she isn't really saying anything",NEGATIVE

Jennifer Hudson knocks it out of the park as the queen of soul, a once in a lifetime perfomance, capturing every aspect of Aretha's life so well that it's hard to imagine anyone but her playing her. Apart from JHud's crowning jewel, and marvel, the supporting cast is simply on",POSITIVE

670,"While it was interesting to see the tie-ins with the original movie and the return of certain characters, the writing as a whole ended up being a convoluted mess (including heavy-handed ""social commentary"" that was ridiculously over the top) that fundamentally disrespects the original film. Tony Todd is only in here for like ... two seconds and has one line. That's it. Blehhhh",NEGATIVE
671,"Here we have another lame attempt at cashing in on the GI Joe franchise. Unfortunately this movie is as worthless as the first two movies and can go straight into the trash bin. They totally rewrote the character's origins from the comics and here we have a version of this character that is just cliched, boring and completely forgettable. Completely the opposite of white washing the character, they made him Asian where he was a white guy in the comics. Well, at least they didn't use Rza as Blind Master again.",NEGATIVE
672,Something new from James Wan which is cool. An Ok-ish movie fun to watch with a cool twist.,POSITIVE
673,"When I watch a movie, I pride myself on sticking it out, no matter how awful it may be. However, when it comes to this cinematic monstrosity, I came perilously close to shutting it off on several occasions -- it's that bad. Director Leos Carax's overstuffed, overlong, virtually unwatchable operatic tragedy tries viewer patience from about 10 minutes in all the way to its much-anticipated conclusion, a welcome outcome that doesn't arrive until more than two hours later. This story of an alleged stand-up comedian (though better characterized as a pathetically enigmatic performance artist) and his celebrated soprano wife who become the proud parents of a gifted marionette sans strings meanders along at a glacial pace and grows ever more ridiculous with each passing frame. The ""music"" (if one can call it that) consists largely of overly repetitive refrains of utterly mundane ""lyrics"" backed mostly by melodies consisting of a fusion of Carl Orff, Philip Glass and excerpts from the crowd scenes in ""Jesus Christ Superstar."" Then there are the performances, which feature an array of issues, including the self-important, miscast portrayal of Adam Driver, the melodramatic overacting of Simon Helberg and the woeful underutilization of Marion Cotillard. I'll admit that I applaud the filmmaker's attempt to try and create something fresh and different, but this ain't it, and how this mess captured the Cannes Film Festival Award for best director is truly beyond me. Unfortunately, this is the kind of arthouse film that tends to give arthouse movies a bad name. By all means, skip this one at all costs.",NEGATIVE
674,"A Marvel não veio para brincar mesmo, Shang-Chi é simplesmente incrível! Claramente um dos melhores filmes solos do MCU, se não até o melhor.",POSITIVE
675,"I literally created this account so I could leave this review. I love the Fast franchise, I've enjoyed pretty much all of them with a couple exceptions; I've seen Fast Five like 20 times. This movie is embarrassingly bad. I give it a 1 instead of a 0 because it has Helen Mirren and Charlize Theron, for some reason. This is one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen in my life. It's supposed to be a breakneck, absurd, action adventure, but it's somehow boring. It takes itself way too seriously. None of the humor lands. The performances seem worse than normal. And the omnipotent magnets were just the icing on the cake. It's like Jesse Pinkman broke into the writers' room, stole the real script, and rewrote it with as many magnets as possible. Complete and total waste of time, absolute garbage.",NEGATIVE

677,"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one surprisingly very fun MCU movie and it surprised me in some ways. I will be honest before watching this film I was little tired of superhero movies being made multiple times over the year and after mediocore Black Widow ,I was thinking how this will be another disposable work but in the end I was wrong and I am glad because of that. Story was nothing new or remarkable but it still had some good laughs,fun and some solid messages. Characters were ok to while fights were nicely choreographed and enterteining.",POSITIVE
678,Honestly this is a good origin story that is being held back by easily rectifiable mistakes. The Biggest part would be the fight sequences were not as good as previous marvel movies. Martial arts in the film were a bit too slow and did not seem as well executed as something like Captain America The Winter Solider. CGI goes from well done to very poor in too many sequences. The last 30 minutes of the film is in my mind very boring. The Fathers back story is good enough where you understand why he is doing what he is doing. Honestly do not understand how this movie did not get some re-shoots and recasts but you get what you get. Tony Leung Chiu-wai does a good job as an antagonist but the choice of Awkifania is actually pretty startling. At best you might be able to argue this movie is a 7-8 max but in my mind too many mistakes gets a 6 out of 10,NEGATIVE
679,"F9 is the most absurd installment to date, for better or for worse? Definitely for worse...

680,"Alright, alright, alright, alright. We're back with the early Halloween season spooks with Malignant. This film is being released in theaters and on HBO Max for 30 days. If you haven't heard of this film, or not a horror fan, the trailer is below. In Malignant, Madison becomes paralyzed by violence in her life and the shocking visions of gruesome murders. She is tormented by these events that turn out to be more than just visions. What's her connection and why should we watch? I'll get to that. As you can see from the trailer, Madison is going through it with these visions/malevolent entity (Gabriel) and so are the victims. That's actually a part of the movie that succeeds. It is not just that you feel stuck in the visions or that you feel a part of the scenes, but the film does a really good job of following Gabriel. In fact, they do so well at it that I started to root for Gabriel in these scenes. Now that I think about it, that might be a negative. Ah, well. Other than the physics of Gabriel's movements, my guy is possibly the most athletic villain of all time and he really brings the pain. The problem with Gabriel and the movie is unlike The Conjuring, we have no clue where his powers come from. It's literally the most random thing in the world, unexplained and just perplexing. I mean even in the final explanation of the the story I sat there and said, ""Why would they think this would work? This makes no sense."" Nevertheless, we come to movies to suspend belief and that is what I had to do. That's a mixed bad and probably the only reason to watch this movie. Let's see the bad guy go wild and be confused why this is even possible while doing it. While saying that, I do appreciate the original perspective Malignant brings on malevolent entities in the horror world. What I don't appreciate is the lack of scares in this flick. The movie starts off in one realm and we just end somewhere completely different. I think we've gone in the paranormal, ghost, demon, monster bag a bit too much recently. This gives us slasher, with a semi-demon, and psychological thriller all mashed in one. I'm not mad at what they tried to do, but the execution of continuity is just non-existent. In writing this film, the addition of a scene or two ,or even a line or two, could've fixed the holes in the understanding of Gabriel. Nothing could've fixed the physics though. But, what that tells me is there's room to grow/expand upon in the series. I'm not certain there will be a second film, but I can see how something could break through again with James Wan leading it. The Conjuring series has been so popular that they might just give Malignant a follow-up. I'd ask for the whole cast to be changed excepted for the lady cop but that might be asking too much. Malignant is a strangely bad but pleasing early Halloween season movie. From all of the commercials and trailers, I feel a bit mislead by Malignant. Then, the title and title sequence gives away a lot more than you need to know. The story is executed in an original way which actually is quite pleasing but also quite ridiculous. Viewers have to give in to the absurdity and impractical physics of the human body for you to truly enjoy this flick. I think horror fans will be a bit disappointed in the scares in the movie but still entertained by the violence. They should grab a handful of popcorn to enjoy the spectacle. General viewers, who may just have HBO Max, this movie is only scary for about 10 minutes altogether, so if you can get past those parts, you might enjoy rolling your eyes at some bloody and ridiculous scenes and faces, under duress.",POSITIVE
681,"It’s Fun While not amazing and has issues with the editing, Snake Eyes is still a major improvement over the previous two attempts at a G.I Joe film with fun action and great performances from Golding and Koji. This is a film you can view two ways, As a G.I Joe film it’s not great, But as a Ninja film it’s a pretty good.",POSITIVE
682,"I can't say I didn't enjoy parts of this, but it wasn't the plot. Amanda Breslins character was poorly written and poorly acted. Damon was generic Murican, though he did have the stoic resolution of a man whose been thru some sheeit. I did love Virginnie and Maya. They were gems in a otherwise lackluster legal thriller? Camille Cottin is gorgeous and magnetic.",NEGATIVE
683,"Every character has a character arc and storyline which way too many movies forget to do, it is a plot that is completely entrancing, and you spend time trying to figure out all these little details and there are still parts that take you by surprise. It was an absolutely enjoyable ride from beginning to end. Even more enjoyable than the actual ride",POSITIVE
684,"The first movie was pretty good, but this sequel is better. The dad is such an interesting character, and we never know whether to root for him or hate him. It is clever how they utilize every nook and cranny of a house for both movies. The action and gore leads somewhere, and it ties things up nicely.",POSITIVE
685,"Beautiful setting, fantastic CGI and a fun story that is actually worthy of Disney. The three 'main actors' do their roles justice and make the action-packed and funny adventure come to life. It's a shame the cursed antagonists don't get more screentime because of the fantastic way they're portrayed and animated. Nevertheless, again a highly recommended Disney movie!",POSITIVE
686,"This movie is so absolutely absurd. So absolutely insane, so incredibly impossible, so wonderfully entertaining, and so charmingly stupid. Stephen Lang’s performance is awesome, and his ending monologue is surprisingly touching. They being said in order to enjoy this film you need to be able to pretty much pretend the first doesn’t exist, which defeats a point in a sequel. They should have just made this the first one",POSITIVE
687,"Fantastic movie, love these two working together. I don't want to ruin the movie so I will leave it short and sweet.",POSITIVE
688,"Touching, well-acted, as well as beautifully filmed and executed, I Carry You With Me is a visceral docu-drama that tells an important story about immigration and LGBTQ identity.",POSITIVE

691,"This movie has changed my life, and my sexuality. It is quite possibly the greatest film of this decade, if not of all time. The lead role, performed by Ryan Reynolds, did an amazing job with what he was given, and i think i came twice. Everyone else was ok i guess, especially that stranger things mf, but ryan sexy reynold stood out from the crowd. After seeing this movie my sexuality had changed instantly, making me instantly fall in love with Guy. I need blue shirt guy so badly.",POSITIVE

693,"It seems like so long that we've been talking about this Aretha Franklin biopic coming out, and now, it's finally here. Yes, Streamers, Respect was released in theaters this weekend - almost 3 years to the day after the Queen of Soul left the building. Many know the highlights of Ms. Franklin's story, but now, Jennifer Hudson get to to flex her singing and acting chops to honor this musical legend. Let's see how she does. In Respect, we get a glimpse of Ms. Franklin's life from the precocious musical prodigy through the tumultuous times until the triumphant and transcendent production of her ""Amazing Grace"" recording. The plot of a biopic can be cliched and filled with tropes that bog down biographical movies. Respect is no different. Even though these tropes depict what occurred in the subject's life, it would be interesting if one of these musical biopics found a way to tell its story without dwelling on what's already been told. Nevertheless, in this one, there is the no-good husband, there is the domineering and indulgent father, there is the sexual abuse, there is the alcohol abuse and there is the ""come to Jesus"" moment for Ms. Franklin. Although the film is packed with biopic cliches, at least, each step of the way is enjoyable and well-told. Since the story is not told in any novel way, it really is just about the music and the performance by Jennifer Hudson that make Respect worthwhile. Yes, Jennifer Hudson won an Oscar for playing Effie White in Dreamgirls. That was a performance that built to one moment of singing that most likely clenched that award for her. I can't say there was a lot of ""acting"". Here, Hudson gives a valiant effort in playing Ms. Franklin. She does a good job of finding her speaking voice and physical mannerism. There is a lot of ""respect"" in this performance. But, you really came for the songs and the singing; and that's where Jennifer Hudson truly kills it. She doesn't sound like Ms. Franklin, but Hudson sing all of the feeling and bombast in each song. She's great. I will say that the film is kind of long. It takes a while to get going, but it picks up around the time Ms. Franklin starts arranging ""Respect"". Once the hits start rolling, the soundtrack takes over and time starts to pass much more quickly. The movie devolves into a highlight reel of the Aretha hits a bit, but that's not much of a complaint when the songs and singing are as good as they are. You'll rarely be bored even if you know where it's going and how it will get there. But, that's a biopic for ya! Ultimately, Respect is just another biopic about a musical legend. There isn't anything new or interesting in the storytelling as it seems all musicians have taken the same life journey. Jennifer Hudson is a good reason to see Respect with her interesting performance as Ms. Franklin and her considerable vocal talent. As the hits start rolling through, Ain't No Way I Think you should miss this, Chain of Fools. Respect that with a box of popcorn.",POSITIVE
694,"Surprised not to have seen this mentioned in other reviews. Not only does this film fail the Bechdel test, but the main female character is mute and then murdered. Two other pivotal women are missing (dying, dead?). Regarding the film-making, changes in tone and credibility are not handled well. Shallow philosophical insights.",NEGATIVE

696,Snake Eyes GI Joe Origins is an enjoyable movie at best Snake Eyes is a very disappointing movie my main problem is the action the action felt messy cutting back and forth there are some good action sequences I like the origin but the story is messy for me it felt off what took me out this movie was that he turned on everyone around the ending I get that he was to find who killed his dad but Tommy cares about everything about snake eyes but snake eyes just turns on everyone another thing this movie set's up more movies why why!!!!!!! I really did not feel like this movie was good the cinematography is awful which sucked the trailer sold me the movie did not work sadly this is one of the most disappointing movies I saw this year the action does not work the thing that works is the cast performances and the Tokyo setting is great that is really it the villain sucks Tommy is an alright character this movie sucked so I give Snake Eyes G.I Joe Origins a C+,NEGATIVE

698,"100% My new favorite Marvel movie. Way exceeded expectations. The best- OST Soundtrack: incredible. Visuals, Humor, Fight Choreography, Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh's acting skills. Ben Kingsley's Humor. The inclusion of Mandarin Chinese dialogue with English at appropriate times was fantastic. Best Hollywood/Chinese culture movie that puts Mulan to shame. I was so Awkwafinad out and was dreading seeing her, but she was perfect for the roll. Glad to see she toned it down a bit. Noticing some of these comments ""didn't care for the family...the lead had no personality""--- This reeks of not having ever interacted or befriended an Asian person. Go into it with open arms and an open heart. Also- what the heck is with all the downvotes for reviews in French or Spanish? If you can't understand why downvote? America is 25% Hispanic, let them review in Spanish if they want.",POSITIVE
699,"Disney has tried over and over with the Pirates movies to copy that first movie and seem to always miss that the first movie had a actually good story. Its overly complicated story that is so illogical it hurts my brain and its much to long.

704,"From the trailer of Shang-Chi, I believed it would be another underdeveloped origin movie with a lackluster villain, but much to my surprise it surpassed my expectations. The film not only delivers on its action, humour and heart but also has fleshed out characters who are deeper than ideas of just good and evil. Overall, it is the best origin movie since 2008′s Iron Man. I’m excited to see where Marvel goes with this new hero.",POSITIVE
705,"This was an incredible film, and quite possible the best film I've ever seen in my life. I've never felt so speechless in a theater before. Those writing negative reviews are likely only doing so because they disagree with the ""political"" themes of the movie, which is absurd. Themes aside, this movie is incredibly well shot, incredibly well written, and simply a masterpiece of art. The way it masterfully ties in modern real world issues, just like how the original film did, was fantastic. I did not expect the movie to be this good. Hats off to everyone who was apart of making this movie. Bravo. Probably the most powerful film I've ever seen. The negative reviews are either missing the point completely and judging this as if it was supposed to be some kind of run-of-the-mill horror film and it wasn't ""scary enough"", or they are ""blue lives matter"" type people who were offended by it. I urge anyone who hasn't watched it to ignore reviews and watch it for themselves. How anyone could give such a masterfully crafted film a 0/10 is astonishing. It almost further drives home the movie's message. Again, bravo to the creators of this film.",POSITIVE

713,"Even if you forget the blatant rewriting of the whole character Snake Eyes (can't have a white ninja in 2021, no sir!), this is quite the stinker of the movie. I've seen people use the words bland and generic, and they are right on the money. It's nothing more than a mediocre action flick, and has little to do with G.I. Joe. At least the former two G.I. Joe movies tried to stay true to the franchise, and where somewhat fun in their campiness.",NEGATIVE
714,"This is what a movie should be. Doesn’t have to always make a statement, vague as life, no need to have a catchy relatable climax. Awesome directing, acting and a raw feeling overall.",POSITIVE
715,"Wow...... Anyone that does not agree that Siobhan Fallon Hogan did not deserve this role (which she made happen herself...) is insane. This movie was honestly amazing. I’m in love with the acting, the natural raw talent. This is a REAL film. I can’t believe how great Siobhan, Robert Patrick & Jake Weary were. Those two supporting her made the flow of this movie feel so real. New comers Peter Munson Hogan, Sinead Hogan, rapper Fat Nick, Justin Linville, & Phil V the NFL Legend who took down OJ (multiple times) blew me away! Such a unique take on this movie. From the cinematography to the music I loved everything ! This movie rules! Go see it, theaters or streaming. NOW!",POSITIVE
716,"This movie's biggest strength is the action. It is so well choreographed and so well captured in camera that it is unlike any movie I've seen. That aside, the characters are solid and give depth to the family dynamic at the heart of the story. Where it fumbles is in the third act that feels like it contrasts a lot that it tried to set up in order to have an over the top fantastical element to the show. Overall very enjoyable and is probably the most appealing Marvel movie since Black Panther.",POSITIVE
717,"Terribly cheesy and corny. Highly unbelievable on multiple levels and pretty simplistic. Turned it off 45 minutes it, couldn't watch any more of it. A real waste of time.",NEGATIVE

719,"For some time now, more than anything since The Village, I've believed with complete certainty that M. Night Shyamalan is a troll. A big one that enjoys to troll his audience, and many inevitably still fall into his game. I've long been tired of his style. That desperate search for a narrative twist that is on a par with what he achieved in The Sixth Sense. He's been looking for that ever since, even if he doesn't admit it. Since then throughout his entire filmography he has tried the same trick, and with the exception of Unbreakable and his two big studio films, in all of them, absolutely all of them, he has failed. Of course, with the considerable difference in quality. Amid the sober tone of The Village, to the miserable film The Happening ended up being, which continues to be the lowest point of his career. Even beyond Lady in the Water. Old is 100% the same. Shyamalan 101. He constructs an intriguing mystery that of course gets the viewer interested. That always happens in all of his films, but soon as they move forward like an hourglass, grain by grain everything deflates. Of course, the metaphor of time being our killer is super clear, and the fear and terror of our own mortality plays a role in it, but that's when the troll comes in and Shaymalan basically tells you: ''Ha HA HA I caught you'' It's almost as if he has a compulsion to surprise the audience with a conclusion that it's supposed to be shocking and at the same time has nothing to do with the expectations created by them, and that would be laudable if those conclusions were at least satisfactory, but Old only reinforces that Shyamalan sucks to write endings and more intelligent dialogue.",NEGATIVE
720,Boring... The most interesting part of this movie is the opening and ending.,NEGATIVE
721,"Free Guy is a movie inspired by the modern online videogames culture, particularly GTA Online. Unlike the similar movie Ready Player One (which was pretty awful IMHO), the plot is quite decent. Ryan Reynolds is the star of the show, but he delivers his jokes and overall funny attitude as if he was playing the Deadpool character he is very well known for. Other notable members of the cast are Joe Keery (Steve in Stranger Things) and Taika Waititi (director of MCU movies ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and ""Thor: Love and Thunder"") in supporting roles. This movie is a decent summer blockbuster, but nothing memorable. If you are unfamiliar with videogames, you better skip this movie because you will understand none of its concepts and references. If you are a gamer, you can happily watch it and have a laugh or two with Ryan Reynolds.",POSITIVE
722,This is now the worst movie I've ever seen. Shyamala needs to stop making movies.,NEGATIVE
723,"Reminiscence is kinda look like Steven Spielberg's Minority Report but it's a totally different story, Jackman's and Ferguson's chemistry and performance is incredible, though they're not even together in person so long, the chemistry is there and so strong, so we and me personally care about it, sad about it, worry about it, and angry about it, Reminiscence is sad and depressing yet it's a very solid film and simply one of the best films of the year.",POSITIVE
724,"There is enjoyment to be had in watching this film. It is campy. It is not as scary as some of Wan's previous work. However, there is an element of horror to it that is somewhat unsettling. I loved the twist. It definitely subverted expectations. And, although there are aspects that I don't understand, the twist makes sense when looking back at the rest of the movie. I wish the third act would have been a little more Alien and a little less Aliens, but it worked in a B-movie kind of way. I think most ""fans"" of James Wan who gave this low scores need to re-watch his previous horror films. All of them have varying degrees of ""camp/cheese"" to them. Malignant wasn't too far off what Wan regularly delivers. I sincerely hope Wan continues to do horror films, now that he's ""in demand."" He's has shown flashes of David Fincher (Saw vs Se7en), Wes Craven (Dead Silence vs A Nightmare on Elm Street), and a mix of William Friedkin and Steven Spielberg (both Insidious and Conjuring films vs The Exorcist and Poltergeist). Malignant has aspects of David Cronenberg and John Carpenter. The more I think about this film, the more I like it.",POSITIVE

Where you expect violence you are met with introspective dialogue about the meaning of creation and the value of meaningful relationships with others and ourselves. While at times this approach feels futile and generates a sense of hopelessness, it never feels unintentional or naive. The film itself is a reflection of the complicated ideas explored within the narrative and by the end you can't help but feel like Cage's character brought on a positive change to those he encountered vice the expected devastation the first fifteen minutes suggests.",POSITIVE

Such movies aren't considered worthy of watching and praising just because they don't belong from a Franchise or Studio. I love watching such movies but only a few movies touch me deeply in this genre like Joker 2019 and the Pursuit of Happiness were my favorite individual movies. I watched this movie but I didn't find its story epic. Yes, it was a good and decent story but as I said that in this genre, only a few movies can touch my heart but unfortunately pig wasn't among all that. But But But... the character of Nicolas Cage is just amazing in this movie and an Oscar-winning character. His character development was too good and his performance was just excellent. I would only suggest you watch this movie for Nicola's performance. The scene where the protagonist was confronting a specific character in a hotel was outstanding. It's an emotional story of a man dealing with his past and present loss. You would love it if you love such poetic movies. But this movie isn't for everyone.",POSITIVE

734,"I will say this without preamble. I'm sick of movies about origins. Especially the origins of characters that are much more interesting when they are already fully formed. Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins is looking to be the flashy new starting point of a franchise after The Rise of Cobra and Retaliation failed to do so for the G.I. Joe brand. However, the people involved forgot to create something coherent and believed they will compensate for all their plot weaknesses with action sequences. I don't deny that this will be enough for some part of the audience, and in terms of basic entertainment this film meets its quota, but in all that remains of its proposal it's mediocre and disappointing. Considering its current results at the box office, I think that even if it seems a little rash to say it now, Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins won't become that launch point for the profitable new franchise that its studio was waiting for.",NEGATIVE

Modernized and updated by director Nia DaCosta and Jordan Peele serving as one of the writers, there's some good slasher fun to be had here at times, but the film also delves into its fair share of predictable horror tropes and cliches as well. The film's third act also feels rushed and somewhat satisfying, but overall, fans of the original may appreciate some of the new ideas here, and visually, it's actually somewhat cool at times.",POSITIVE

742,"The first part is very intriguing, but it all becomes very repetitive very early. Acting is not that bad, but the characters don't have a very satisfying trajectory; it's quite obvious what will happen to them from very early. And the last act is just bonkers; the director tries to channel 'Suspiria,' but it feels very cheap. There's also a supernatural element that will make your eyes roll. Wished the plot could've followed what was laid out at the beginning.",NEGATIVE
743,"No. No. No. No! This movie is terrible. The entire time I was watching the clock going, 'when is the horror supposed to start?'- in the LAST 5 MINUTES the film tries its best to show us its take on horror and it's pathetic. The bee face CGI is bad, and the nonsense Candyman spouts is laughable. The kills are mostly done off-screen so, why even bother filming them? If the director is so against showing gore, just cover it up with a fluffy teddy bear or pixilation - just don't insult the audience with these 'artistic' shots. The film spends sooooooo much time trying to develop other characters but for what reason? There is no character development, only a bunch of woke morons spouting junk. The main character himself is just practically a caveman when it comes to acting. The acting overall is terrible and the plot is... I have no idea why anyone did what they did quite frankly. But the biggest insult is how it treats the first film as a sort of stepping stone for this one. If you're going to turn the Candyman into fictional mythos for a sort-of sequel then sure, but don't retroactively ruin the first film with your woke rubbish. The first Candyman was scary, well acted and interesting. Tony Todd was an insanely cool Candyman in 1992, but 2021 Candyman is just a chad with a hook. If you've read the subtle clues in my review, then you can tell that this film is GARBAGE. Avoid don't bother, especially if you loved the first film.",NEGATIVE
744,"Sometimes you think you know someone and later find out that he/she turns out to be something totally different. So it is to a surprising degree with Helen Keller, the renowned blind and deaf author and lecturer who is perhaps best known for her work as an ardent advocate for those with disabilities. However, as director John Gianvito's new documentary about the iconic figure reveals, Keller was also a radical socialist, one who unabashedly lambasted the capitalist-militarist system and zealously fought for the rights of women, laborers, minorities and the impoverished. She championed the Russian Revolution and was a member of the International Workers of the World, actions that eventually brought her under surveillance by the FBI. This is not to suggest that she was unpatriotic, but she strongly felt that the American system was broken in many ways and needed to be significantly reformed to bring about fairness, justice and equality. Years later, however, when she saw how socialist ideals had been corrupted by parties like the Soviets, she backtracked somewhat, not from a theoretical standpoint but definitely from a practical one, a move that probably contributed to the downplaying of her prior views and her reputation as an activist social reformer. The film does a fine job in bringing all this to light, and its singularly distinctive approach makes this one of the most stylish documentaries to be released in some time. However, I can't say I agree with some of the filmmaker's stylistic choices, such as the use of lengthy quotes presented as on-screen graphics requiring considerable viewer reading -- enough to try the patience of even those who generally feel comfortable reading subtitles. There is also some inconsistent treatment in the presentation of the material, keeping the film from striking a consistent tone and rhythm. In the end, ""Her Socialist Smile"" may prove eye-opening in many ways, and the path chosen for delivering those revelations may indeed be a distinctive one, but the overall production feels somewhat off-kilter as a piece of filmmaking, one whose noble attempts at doing something different don't quite click as well as they could have.",POSITIVE

There's not a whole lot in the way of story other than Dom's (Vin Diesel) brother (John Cena) coming back from the past to settle a personal vendetta against him and his crew. As usual, the action is over-the-top to point of just being mind-numbing at times, and the acting definitely isn't Oscar-worthy. Regardless, it's still fun enough (I suppose) if you go in expecting it to be the disposal popcorn flick that it is. Overall, it's certainly not what I'd call one of the better entries in the franchise, but it does raise the stakes and keeps things entertaining enough to a point. And spoiler alert: in addition to an out-of-place and pointless cameo from Cardi B, this franchise really jumps the shark towards the end by venturing out of earth-territory if you know what I mean.",POSITIVE

750,"The lesson you can all take from Old is if you find yourself en route to a secluded location and your driver is M. Night Shyamalan maybe you need to rethink your decision and get the hell off the bus. I'll give it one thing, I definitely wasn't bored. A family travel to a tropical island for a holiday and discover that the secluded beach they are relaxing at for a few hours is somehow causing them to age rapidly. Naturally everyone freaks out and tries to find a way off the beach before they literally run out of time. I think I can speak for most people when I say the aging process is a real fear many of us have. No one wants to get old. So to base a movie on the premise of aging rapidly is a scary concept. Well at least I thought so. Based on a graphic novel, M. Night has taken an already scary idea and ramped it up to the max. When Prisca (Vicky Krieps) and Guy (Gael García Bernal) realise their children have aged by years in just a few hours panic ensues. It's ridiculous, cringey and the dialogue seems disjointed and a bit like everyone is just reading their lines. There's also the strange editing and close ups that just start to annoy you after a while. I feel Old has a great idea and it's well executed to a point but the more it drags on the more silly it becomes. It doesn't have the same ""oh **** moments that some other M. Night films have. There are a few laughs scattered throughout, only I'm not sure if you're really meant to be laughing at them. I didn't love Old but I didn't hate it either. It has its moments but overall it's not great. The performances from most of the cast seem bland and wooden. I feel this was close to being top tier Shyamalan but Old ends up being somewhere between The Happening and Split. Shyamalan is one of those film makers who really divides audiences, most of you will either love or hate his movies. Old isn't exactly his best but it's not his worst either. Look you get what you expect, the trailer sets it all up so all you have to do is get yourself into a nice air-conditioned cinema, sit back and enjoy this intense thriller. And if you didn't like it, that's fine, and if you loved it that's also fine. Like I said, Shyamalan's movies can be hit or miss, the only way you're going to find out is if you see it for yourself. Recommended for all the M. Night fans.",NEGATIVE
751,"It has some decent action scenes, but nearly all of them are ruined by out of place gags like the IG Live guy on the bus or Awkwafina for the rest of the movie. This makes it hard to stay invested. It gets serious for a stretch during the third act (where it crams all the character development), but then the goofiness of the multiple buttons rob what could have been a decent ending of all impact. The characters are left totally unaffected by the events that transpire making you question whether they are sociopaths.",NEGATIVE
752,"Candyman is a fairly good thriller/ horror film that definitely pays homage to the original 1992 film in many ways. However, the problems with Candyman start to show near the end of the film as the plot gets fairly confusing at that point. Also this movie is very short, far shorter than I thought it would be. Another twenty minutes of plot would have been a reasonable addition, and maybe could have cleared up some of the confusing parts at the end of the film.",NEGATIVE
753,"In case you don’t know (I didn’t), the G.I. Joe franchise is a whole world of action heroes, much like the Marvel Universe. The titular character (played by Henry Golding, whose not especially charismatic and lets British accent slip a few times) is taken from his hard knock street fighter life in LA to the world of ancient Japanese clans and ninja warriors. He undergoes 3 challenges in his training, but struggles with the losses from his past. The fight scenes are snappy, but they’re shot with such a dizzying camera that it’s often hard to see what’s really happening. As the genre goes, this is a competent addition, but one that will also quickly be forgotten.",POSITIVE
754,"A truly special ride. Only (ridiculously small) quibble was with a few of the effects, but most of the effects were amazing. Cast was wonderful - Simu Liu is a STAR, Awkwafina and Tony Leung were incendiary, the entire rest of the cast were perfect. The action is so far beyond most other action movies, it’s almost playing a different sport. The heart of the movie, though - the struggle to find one’s self amidst family turmoil and the expectations of father and the loss and grief embodied beautifully in the movie…THAT is why the movie is truly special.",POSITIVE
755,"Free guy was a great movie, my wife and I really enjoyed it. The story was refreshing and the CGI was well executed",POSITIVE
756,"A top 3 Marvel Movie. The actions scenes are probably some of the best in the MCU, Wenwu is one of my favourite villains, the visuals and cgi are insane, the chemistry between all of the characters is impeccable, the music and cultural appreciation couldn’t have been any better. Not just a perfect Marvel movie, but a perfect movie in general that’ll hopefully be nominated for some sort of academy award",POSITIVE
757,"By no means was this movie scary, the police station scene was ridiculous. I thought the idea for the antagonist was clever but got a little out of hand. The ending was bleak.",NEGATIVE
758,"Marvel makes another ""B"" grade movie, which is by no means an insult. However, I couldn't help shake the feeling that I had seen this Marvel movie before. In other words, these films are becoming formulaic, especially since I've seen every one of them. Combine that with the new shows and I wonder if they're starting to get too saturated. This film and one medium flaw and a handful of small flaws in my opinion, but nothing major. The medium flaw was a character's motive three quarters into the film and some of the smaller issues was overreliance and sometimes questionable CGI (reminded me of Black Panther's not so good CGI in parts). Also, it was pretty predictable if you've seen a ton of movies over your lifetime, but again, it's a superhero flick. It dragged a smidge in Act 3 as well. On the positives, it didn't rely on a bunch of clichés in addition to the action/martial arts being top notch. The characters were likeable and world building was solid. IMO Marvel makes about 15% ""A"" films, 70% ""B"" films, and 15% ""C"" films. This can be thrown in with the majority.",NEGATIVE
759,"G.I. Joe ""The Ultimate Weapon of Democracy"" - yeah, not so much anymore. The movie was just not good, unless you look at it from the perspective of a production company taking over a character and twisting it into something opposite of what the character originally was. I think the actors are okay, but it seems like it's got to be really hard for them to overcome bad writing, disloyalty to the source material, and in many cases bad camera work. There was so much great material written by the comic book creators in the 80's that it's so odd to see them gut Snake Eyes and reanimate his corpse. It's sad. This is not Snake Eyes, this is Fake Eyes. If you'd really like to see Snake Eyes done well, check out G.I. Joe Resolute.",NEGATIVE
760,"Wow! This movie's take on video games and coding will turn a few people off, but under the hood this is a great story about AI and it is hilarious. Go see it. Went in expecting a terrible movie and everyone in the theater was laughing and cheering by the end.",POSITIVE

762,"This movie is something else. A fresh and funny story and a must see for gamers because of the many references and crossovers to the gaming industry. Where Ryan Renolds once again portrayed his character fantastically, the rest of the cast also fitted perfectly into the setting and the story. Of course there are the classic cliché scenes of love, action and humor, but the combination of reality and the digital world made it feel different than in any other film. Besides, there were moments when you actually start thinking, what if AI will actually ever become so smart that it will take on its own life? This thought is fantastic and scary at the same time.",POSITIVE

764,"I like the fast franchise a lot, but the film goes to far out of the way of normal. Going to outer space, involving a giant family origin in the ninth installment and rushing into the plot within 10 minutes were the biggest mistakes of the movie. It could of been a whole let better with a better directing job.",NEGATIVE
765,"While the acting, concept and premise is good, the execution at the end is off . Also, the positives do not outweigh the cringiness I felt when the film tries to justify the husband's becoming a serial killer out of the duty to protect his wife.",NEGATIVE

767,"While the film is a bit heavy-handed at times, this documentary should be viewed by every American who is unfamiliar with the DeHart case. It is a terrifying glimpse into the nature of the American police state.",POSITIVE
768,"The moment, early in the film, that the filmmakers directly rip off an Indiana Jones gag (Indy breaking into the tomb in the library, striking the ground at the same time the clerk is stamping papers) tells you just how original Jungle Cruise will be. It's the shadow/rip-off of much better films, from the original Pirates, Raiders, the 90's Mummy and naturally The African Queen. Oh, and toss in a 101 Best Dad Jokes book. The leads have charm and charisma, but I'd rather spend a half hour with them chatting on, say the Graham Norton show, then two plus hours of this manufactured mess. It wants to be the model of the ""rousing"" adventure with that friendly family feeling from the 80's and 90's. Anytime you see four screenwriters, you're usually in for a bumpy ride. The jokes that don't know when to end. The beating a point over the head till it's flattened (if you had a drinking game every time Blunt' s characters pants are mentioned, you'd be dead by the first hour). And the score is such a CVS version of John Williams, he should get royalties. I am bumping this up a bit solely on the performance of Jesse Plemmons, God bless him, as the German officer. Seeing him get orders from some bees (yup), is something you don't see everyday.",NEGATIVE

778,"Taking on an entrenched, centuries-old social, religious and political patriarchy is no easy feat, but the protagonist in director Teona Strugar Mitevska's latest offering unwittingly does just that. Set in the small Macedonian community of Stip, a discouraged, unemployed, single, plus-sized, thirty-something spinster who still lives with her parents becomes the unlikely center of attention when she impulsively participates in and wins a traditional male-only competition, inciting claims of impropriety, invoking civil unrest and theft of a religious icon (with no legal basis for backing up any of the charges, despite inflated vague allegations that she broke ""the rules""). While the film crackles with biting satire and delivers an important and empowering message for women, it tends to get bogged down in repetitive, circular arguments at times, making the picture come across as somewhat heavy-handed and dogmatic (at least to viewers who reside in more tolerant and open-minded societies). But, then, for a culture that has long fought against progressive social change, perhaps such a sledgehammer approach is what's needed to get the message across to those who have staunchly resisted it and used whatever means available to them to reinforce such an archaic view. To many, it might seem that films like this should no longer be necessary in this day and age, but the fact that it was made suggests the opposite and that there's yet more work to be done.",NEGATIVE
779,"This saga can no longer continue, there are no more fresh things to tell, they only saturate with the same, the cast count on some super soldier serum since they don't suffer any damage. In conclusion we have something ridiculous without any sense.",NEGATIVE

Even though I don't understand Chinese i'm glad some of the dialogue is in Chinese I love the way it sounds. The fight scenes are so cool and and I love the fantasy settings. The cast is great Katy is so funny and loveable and I'm hoping to see more of her and Shang-Shi and Xialing. I'd give this movie a 9.7 and round it up to 10.",POSITIVE

782,"Unbelievable how far this franchise has come. From car tuning to... I don't even know what that is. An incredible load of action, accentuated of course by unrealistic physics, but I'm not criticizing that. The series has been pushing the boundaries of realism in these exploding scenes for a long time now, and that doesn't bother me so much. It's a nice spectacle. Where the problem lies is more in the story, which just kinda sucks here. The plot, like something out of a sci-fi movie, and then there's that one location that was already really over the top, but I don't want to spoil that for you. On top of that, we get characters from previous episodes returning, which is cool, but including Han, who as we can already know...(those who haven't seen Tokyo Drift spoiler!)...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................is long dead. Even though it was explained in the movie how it's possible that he survived, I still think they shouldn't have revived Han. My opinion. What's cool are the flashbacks that Dom has here. They're cool, but unfortunately that's probably the best thing about the movie. Add to that the ending, which just didn't satisfy me. Not to just criticize the film, I praise the music, which was really cool in places, and maybe the action, which although it's really overdone, is at least nice to watch and a blast for action lovers. For me, an average film that I don't recommend even to fans of the series.",POSITIVE

The bus sequence is kinda fine and then it goes down hill into a hackneyed you can see it a mile a way family drama and turns into cgi wuxia crap by the end. Also disney inserted a plushie type character. Ugh. ben kingsley was by far the most interesting character in the movie everybody else is pretty stock.

800,"I got the chance to see this, via Screen Unseen at Odeon. And God, I was disappointed. I had 3 main gripes with this mediocre mess: cinematography, writing, and casting. Starting off, I found nothing of narrative worth, interesting or new concepts, or entertaining jokes. I think I only laughed once, something beyond a nasal exhale. Whilst talking plot, they clearly don't understand how online games work, even how servers work at all. Games don't slowly just dissapear when being turned off, and in this case, destroyed. The characters don't change at all, or change in literally half a second. Especially the human characters. The ending comes to mind, with her randomly realising the programmer dude, forgot what he's called, just that generic, loves her or whatever. Randomly cuts in the middle of the hug too for whatever reason. Cinematography to me just felt generic. Bland. Nothing. No interesting colour uses, similar lighting throughout, just half assed. I guess the repeating shots are interesting, following the patterns of AI, I suppose. Casting was a major issue, as with the presence of Taika Waititi. The first thing that comes to mind when a gaming company CEO comes up, is not an old dude from New Zealand, dressed in a mix between hobo clothes and Supreme. This instantly came off to me as The Lego Movie -esque rip off. Just lazy. First original movie I saw in cinemas this year, and it was trash. Fantastic.",NEGATIVE
801,"Watching this movie is such a waste of time. At first I was interested in the misogynist aspect of the film, soon I really didn't care about the characters or the plot. If False Positive was a fish, it would be a puffer.",NEGATIVE
802,"The MCU has finally reached a point where we have seen a lot of weird stuffs, So they can throw something really crazy at us and we will just accept it as normal. That's what I love about this movie, it takes you to a wild journey where anything can happen. The movie has a lot of surprises, a great villain and a good story even if I wasn't a big fan of the jokes that the movie throws at you every time anything happens. In conclusion, this is the kind of movie that you will enjoy if you watch it to have fun. This movie is far from a masterpiece, but at the same time, feels like they finally portrayed the craziness of the comics in the big screen without the fear that it could be too much for the audience.",POSITIVE
803,"(Mauro Lanari) Why label an exploitation film as action, once again produced by Leitch with 10 or 20 stunt performers for each actor, gory, sanguinary and proud not to give a damn about the plot?

804,"why bother calling this candyman. it started out possibly ok - there was a bunch of threads and callbacks etc but then by the ending they left out plot threads and then went full hamfisted mode. its a terrible piece of hot garbage. this movie has a ""message"" but ruins the story because of the message.",NEGATIVE
805,"First, Cruella, and now, The Blind Man. What's with the obsession of turning irredeemable villains into brutal yet lovable anti-heroes? 'Don't Breathe 2' is a cheap way of turning the brilliant first film into another franchise. I mean, Norman's still cool and all, but you need to forget all he did in the first film to follow this new characterization. And don't get me started on the plot: totally ridiculous, especially the second half. Let's hope they leave this man alone once and for all.",NEGATIVE
806,They absolutely missed the mark on this one. I enjoy the newer fast movies like hobbs vs shaw and fast 7 but this one was just unenjoyable. Vin Diesel is a really stale actor and John Cena is the same. The movie has a terrible plot that is probably the worst one so far. Charlize Theron is unbearable. A lot of the dialogue is laughably bad with terrible humour and boring exposition.,NEGATIVE
807,"Ryan Reynolds stars as a background Non-playable character in a popular online shooter akin to 'Fortnite', and finds himself becoming more and more conscious and aware of his surroundings and day-to-day life as he becomes bored with his daily programming and evolves into a conscious artificial intelligence that tries to break free of his programmed system. With the help of a human player he happens to fall in love with (Jodie Comer), him and the rest of the NPC characters try to rebel against the online world they've been limited to, and must try and stop a greedy gaming CEO (Taika Waititi) from deactivating and shutting them down for good. The trailers for this film gave off major 'Saints Row' vibes to me, along with other similar online shooters, but I found myself intrigued nonetheless. And I can say that after going in with only modest expectations, this film turned out to be an absolute riot, both literally and figuratively, and I mean in a very good way! I had so much fun watching this film and getting immersed within this world and all the bonkers action and antics it had to offer! There's some surprising and welcome cameos throughout, and like any video game-themed, of course there was bound to be some Easter eggs and references to other games and pop culture references here and there, but thankfully the film surprisingly isn't overly saturated with them, unlike with another particular video game-themed film (Ready Player One). In addition, Reynolds is just as funny and entertaining as ever, bringing in that same chipper attitude that he brings to Deadpool all the time. Jodie Comer also holds her own quite well alongside him, although I wasn't exactly comfortable with the 17-yr age gap between her and Reynolds",POSITIVE
808,"In a way, I can't help feeling a little trace of disappointment, this because of what the film tries and does not materialize. No Sudden Move looks good. It has fine actors starring, and above all it has the experienced hand of Steven Soderbergh in the direction, and yet it fails to exceed the average. No Sudden Move is a story of betrayals, but these are not really outstanding because the mystery created is quite soft. Complication after complication pile up until they lead to a loose and flabby ending. There's not a vibrant pulse that makes the film fascinating or more exhilarating. It's hard for me to find the exact words, but what I'm trying to say is that the film doesn't manage to conjure up enough elements to be more memorable, or at least deliver on what it originally seemed to have promised. For Soderbergh's filmography it will be a medium film. I have no doubts about it. Is not bad, but it won't be one that will shine later on.",NEGATIVE

814,"You could be forgiven for thinking this is one of those Liam Neeson-esque movies where he punches his way through all the bad guys in order to rescue his daughter/wife etc. Stillwater is a much more toned down movie than the trailer would have you believe. Bill (Matt Damon) flies out to Marseilles to visit his estranged daughter Allison (Abigail Breslin) who is currently in prison for the murder of a college student she was sharing an apartment with. Allison is insistent she did not commit this crime and is trying to get the investigation reopened. Bill is determined to prove his daughter’s innocence and starts some of his own investigation into a possible new lead. He soon realises that as an American navigating his way through Marseilles with the language barrier and culture shock is more difficult than he imagined. If you feel this idea rings a bell, it is very loosely based on a real life case, there are some similarities but Stillwater has no “based on true events” quote at any point nor does it claim to have any connection with real life events. There’s a few themes running at once, and it’s drifting between family drama and legal thriller. Damon’s character particularly as the out of place American going through a journey as he spends more time in Marseilles and develops a friendship with Virginie (Camille Cottin). Bill could have been a difficult character to pull off and have the audience sympathize with and care about. With a different actor it could have been a disaster but Damon was 100% the right choice. I liked Stillwater for the most part but at almost 2 hours and 20 minutes, it’s far too long for this type of film. It’s very drawn out and a bit dull in places. There was no need for it to drag on so much and could have easily lost 20 minutes. That aside the performances from Damon, Breslin and Cottin are the strongest thing you can take from Stillwater and really hold the film together. Recommended.",POSITIVE
815,"In film, being ambitious and pretentious is something that happens a lot. And frankly it's not a bad thing. I love ambitious filmmakers, especially if they're capable of challenging you. The problem appears when the filmmaker in question, doesn't have what it takes to justify those ambitions and pretensions. And unfortunately, in my opinion for Leos Carax and his Annette, that's what happens. I have to make it clear. Annette is not a bad movie. My review may sound like this, but trust me, it is not. Annette is exuberant, thought-provoking, bizarre, and suggestive, but at the same time suffers from a notable lack of balance. I don't deny that there will be many people who will be able to admire what it's trying to do in a different way. However, trying to be surreal, provocative and intense is a risky move that can end up being a double-edged sword, because even with your fervent visual style, all of this can look pretty good on screen, but ultimately when you don't add depth to anything, the show ends up being hollow. Yes, it will be a show that looks very nice, that has spectacular visuals, that is competently directed, that its music is good, that its lead actor is really solid, but that also squanders its lead actress, and fails to become the wonderful rock opera, that I can believe its creator envisioned. And all this overloaded adventure with its more than excessive 140 minutes, can't help but seem lacking in better arguments to defend its position. Unfortunately for Annette, regardless of its qualities and most notorious elements, it's also a film that tries to be a lot when it's actually saying very little. It's not a disappointment. Far from it. I really think it's a good film, however it cannot avoid the issue of pointing up to the stars, yet it never takes off the ground.",NEGATIVE
816,"Let's say it. Great fight sequences won't make this movie less boring. It really has it's moments but it also sunks into the WTF territory and slow pace of scenes bridging movie acts, makes it hard to watch. Trevor from Iron Man 3 returns as an unfanny companion to the main characters. Marvel took some lessons from Monsterverse movies and this time as a subplot we have two mystical mythological creatures representing chaos and order (or good and evil) entagled in fight against each other. No Shou-Lao or Fing Fang Foom references anywhere. Also... Mandarin is a chicken stew. The most developed character is Shang Chi's father. The worst and out of everything is the Razor Fist, turned into some bulky mindless drone. The story is more straight than Zuckerberg's confused reptilian face, reassembling the plot of LOTR movies... go from point A to B. Overall... not a good flick FOR ME. Also Kevin Feige started damage control weeks ago before the movie premiered, now I know why.",NEGATIVE

822,"It’s got some major pacing issues, but there’s a lot of fun Easter eggs and Ryan Reynolds doing his best Ryan Reynolds impression. Better than Ready Player One.",POSITIVE
823,"Starting with homage and evolving to outright insane fun, Malignant is a tribute to the best of 80s american and italian horror, while also becoming it's own unique beast that should not be missed by any horror fan!",POSITIVE
824,Feels real. Sometimes too real. It's a movie that left me wishing it would take a left turn into a Hollywood cliché to make everything alright. It refuses and ends up being a slice of life on film. Someone wrote that it feels like you spend real time with real people going through some really tough sh*t. I couldn't agree more. I liked spending that time with these people.,NEGATIVE
825,Literally watched the first GiJoe movie before watching this one and had so much fun. I always loved snake eyes as a kid and this was a great action packed movie.,POSITIVE
826,"Soderberg returns to the Detroit area, all these years after Out Of Sight, with a tale that feels like Elmore Leonard lite. Small time criminals get involved with what should be a simple heist, that gets twisted and complicated. The cast is stellar across the board, with an uncredited cameo that'll put a smile on your face. It's definitely mid level Soderbergh, but the cast pushes this to above average.",POSITIVE
827,"Marvel is making here a desperate effort to conquer the screens of our Asian neighbors. But don't expect at any moment to be surprised by anything else than what Marvel always did. The scenario is bland and really predictable. Jokes are definitely 'marvelesque' as they tend to become parodies of themselves. The pace is really weird thanks to these numerous flashbacks that respond to each other. I found the characters were really unattractive and uncharismatic (especially Simu Liu as Shang-chi), in addition to the fact that Xialing (Shang-chi's sister interpreted by Meng'er Zhang) had a huge unused potential. The very end is really underwhelming thanks to the unoriginal and traditional cliff-hanger. The power of the rings is only questioned at the very end, making it unexplained during the whole movie. Fight scenes are great even if repetitive and a bit long. The movie generally focuses way too much on events and plot rather than on relations (excepted between father - mother - Shang-chi - Xialing), which is quite disappointing ; the few we see is poorly written. Despite all this, the music (from 88rising) is absolutely gorgeous even if asian-stereotyped here and there. The CGI is great (yes, it just takes a lot of money to make it happen) and allows the final scenes to be as grand as you would expect from a Marvel movie. The colours are great and the lighting is top notch.",POSITIVE
828,"Vin Diesel and the gang are back for another series of outrageous stunts. This time they even more brazenly defy the laws of physics. The plot is standard: They’re saving us from an evil genius who wants to control the world via computer chips. In an attempt to add heart, each of the cast members gets their moment for emotion (or humor in some cases), sometimes with flashbacks. Even so, these “heartfelt” moments are just there to pass time til the next action beat, most of which are spectacularly over the top. While some action flix boast large body counts, this one piles up the crashed cars. Still, that’s what the audience expects, although frankly, it's getting a bit overdone. NOTE: Stay thru the early credits for one surprise cameo.",NEGATIVE
829,"Soderbergh's best film since 'Logan Lucky.' There's a moment when it's kind of difficult to follow all the twists and turns the story has to offer, but 'No Sudden Move' is an entertaining film about the true extent of capitalism and how regular joes are always destined to lose.",POSITIVE
830,"The first 2/3rds of this movie are really good, and well written. I found myself sympathasizing w/Matt Damons character. And I liked how well written his daughters character possibly wrongly stuck in prison. I even liked the single Mom and wise beyond her years daughter and how they basaically adopted this stranger in a strange land. But then in the last act? Matt Damons character loses his mind, and the movie goes off the rails. I liked 2/3rd of it, but the last half hour or so really disappointed me and didn't fit the rest of the movie.",NEGATIVE
831,I highly recommend this home invasion horror/thriller! The child is the only person that views the blind man as a good person in the end and that makes sense because she doesn’t have another reference. Definitely a must see!,POSITIVE
832,This movie is horrible. I will need therapy after watching this. They might as well given people super powers and have them fly around.,NEGATIVE
833,"The acting, the sets, the cars and the costumes were great. But the story ran off the rails in the second half of the movie. In the end, I didn't care who lived and who died after all the double and triple crosses. Thumbs up for the acting and sets. Thumbs down for it's convoluted story.",NEGATIVE
834,"Jungle Cruise is a pretty fun ride from Disney, with its high budget and gloss. While it is derivative of its previous flicks, It is buoyed by the strong chemistry between the Rock and Emily Blunt. Otherwise, it's business as usual from the House of Mouse.",POSITIVE
835,"It was OK but not as good as I was hoping it would be. Entertaining but I lost interest. Very bloody and gory. I don’t find that scary just gross. I was hoping for something new but like Friday the 13th, Halloween, nightmare on Elm Street… very weak storyline cutting people up lots of blood and gore, blah",NEGATIVE
836,"A very nice surprise! You'll enter 'Pig' expecting a big pile of bodies, but the sole thing that'll get piled up are tears. Even the bad guy has a small arc worth exploring. But the best part is that Nicholas Cage gives one of those stoic performances that'll make you remember the best moments of his career. Check it out.",POSITIVE
837,I don't think I have ever rated a movie on this site but I need to for this one. Absolutely Fantastic!!! WOW! It's that simple of a review....watch and enjoy this refreshing movie we all need right now.,POSITIVE
838,Rock's dad jokes carry this movie to a legendary level. His jokes really help you cruise through this film.,POSITIVE
839,"The subject is already apparent from the title and any press/previews. A group of people ends up on a beach where they rapidly age. Since it’s written/directed by M. Night Shyamalan you can hope for a suspenseful approach and dark thrills, plus a surprise twist. The revelation was unexpected, but not shocking. The tension never manifests. It’s just a sci-fi mystery that’s only interest is watching how and when the cast will change. On the plus side, the beach is lovely and Shyamalan’s big-screen style keeps it visually attractive. Other than that, this is just a mediocre episode of The Twilight Zone. BTW, the director introduces the screening with a welcome back to the movies and he has a cameo as the van driver.",POSITIVE
840,Super cool movie all about futuristic stuff Those who love open world Games would love the movie. A must watch,POSITIVE
841,This film surprised me because I thought it was going to be a run of the mill kids movie. This film is great for what it is and has a ton of fun references,POSITIVE
842,"Garbage, worst fast and furious movie of all, stay away from this, This is a warning!",NEGATIVE
843,"It's humorous, but it's also supposed to be horror, yet it never takes advantage of both genres and stakes. Its own execution provokes it, and that thing, despite the charisma, took away many points from the whole story. Especially the incredibly weak conclusion. It didn't displease me, but it was underwhelming to say the least. I would recommend it for a weekend. You can forget about it after that.",NEGATIVE
844,"not sure where all the hate comes from. don’t compare this to other movies, take it for what it is. this is a fun sci-fi crime mystery movie. Rebecca Ferguson and hugh hackman had such good chemistry and the visuals were stunning in the film. the plot kept you hooked throughout. felt like the story couldn’t used a little refinement as there were some dull scenes i def would of cut. but overall solid watch and would recommend to my friends",POSITIVE
845,"Laughingly bad to the point I had to stop the movie and fast forward to the end, which was cringe worthy.",NEGATIVE
846,"A child abductor who killed the girls she captured has escaped from prison many years later and is coming for the one girl who escaped from her but then, people in her town start getting murdered and it's not clear who is actually doing it.",NEGATIVE
847,"I was excited for this movie, but it was terrible, and I was thoroughly disappointed. It was not the least bit exciting or horrifying, which sucks because the Candyman is a cool character that deserved a better movie than this. Not really sure what they were trying to accomplish. There are a few cool shots and some decent acting, but that's about it. The plot goes nowhere and the dialog is terrible. Don't waste your time/money",NEGATIVE
848,"A damn good solo movie to be perfectly blunt. I can see this competing with Black Panther & Doctor Strange as my favorite debut solo movie. The soundtrack is amazing, the action sequences are top notch, the plot is to the point but still interesting. Will say the post-credit scenes are a bit underwhelming but still enjoyed them.",POSITIVE
849,"I fully enjoyed this film. I saw it in a real movie theater, not on my couch [where I have been viewing many films over the past year due to the pandemic]. It was engaging and engulfing from the get go. Some of us prefer a slowly developing format with twists and turns. The acting performances were stellar. From reading other reviews, it appears people do not have patience for a story to unfold at its own pace, and prefer fast action and violence. It is loosely based on a true story, but does not present itself as art imitating life. It was refreshing to see a good drama on the big screen.",POSITIVE
850,"Хороший фильм, но иногда диалоги очень затянуты. Концовку сильно растянули",NEGATIVE
851,M Night Shyamalan is a fantastic director. I do not understand why everybody hates him so much. Even his worst movie is still better than most other directors best movies including Spielberg. Old is no exception.,POSITIVE
852,"I liked the visual approach, but the film makes Sylwia look like someone or something is forcing her to be like that. I mean, it's not that they've just discovered that not everything is as it seems. Director Magnus von Horn doesn't make any judgments, but the stance proves to be very mild and not that interesting. Sylwia even says that it all could go away with just the click of a button, so why wouldn't she do it? Why make a video about how lonely you are and not take action? 'Sweat' tries to convince us that influencers are humans too, but I just couldn't connect with the ""see, they have problems like you, but still get everything for free and promote stupid things people don't need."" What I really liked here is the idea of capitalism vs communism; the new way vs. the old, represented in the strained relationship between Sylwia and her mother.",NEGATIVE
853,"I was saddened by the writer's characterization of Snake Eyes. It's unforgivable what they just did in a movie. They turned Snake's Eyes, a powerful and amazing figure, into a villain. Was that necessary? His redemption arc was terrible and unjustified.",NEGATIVE
854,"Candyman 2021 is a direct sequel to the original 1992 Candyman and ignores the other sequels. It gives enough backstory to introduce a new audience and it’s not essential to have seen the original beforehand. I had high expectations, but unfortunately Candyman did not meet them. Set in present day Chicago, years after the last of the Cabrini Green towers was torn down. Anthony McCoy’s (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) career as an artist has been waning but he becomes reinvigorated after an encounter with a Cabrini Green resident who retells the horrific story behind the Candyman. Anthony begins to explore the ghost story of the supernatural killer who can be summoned by anyone daring to say his name five times while staring into a mirror. The more Anthony delves into the true story behind the Candyman he unwittingly opens a door, and unleashes a terrifying new wave of violence and horror. Candyman, directed by Nia DaCosta was one of the few horrors I was looking forward to this year. I’m sure DaCosta will go on to make some great movies, because despite my disappointment it’s well directed and has a lot of nice, artistic visuals. It starts off promising, creates the right atmosphere and keeps a similar tone to the original Candyman. I really did like the first half but unfortunately the second half morphs into a different movie and completely falls apart. It felt like those cheap generic horrors that I’ve seen again and again. There are far too many scenes of people standing in front of mirrors saying Candyman over and over again. I thought the trailer was overdoing it but that was just a taste of what the film has instore for you. One scene specifically stands out, set in a high school, and appeared so out of place it honestly feels like it was added in from another movie altogether. I felt Candyman was two movies forced together, a great horror spliced with a really bad one. Perhaps my expectations was too high but this really should have been a lot better, I know a lot of film fans will be seeing this one and most likely it will do very well at the box office. Having said that, it might be best to lower the expectations in order for those of you who haven’t seen it to enjoy it a lot more than I did. Recommended for fans of the Candyman franchise, but honestly you’d be better off watching the 1992 version.",NEGATIVE
855,"This is an environmental expose of the evils of capitalism disguised as a mediocre heist movie -- with a heaping helping of leftist ideology. On the positive side, it's a top shelf cast delivering solid performances and the film looks good, but you've seen better work from all the actors elsewhere. It's interesting, at first, to try to figure out the puzzling web of characters and their motivations until you learn you can tell the heroes from the bad guys and losers simply by skin color. Easy! Gender too. They even tossed in a couple lesbians, for no apparent reason other than extra virtue signaling by the filmmakers. It makes the whole thing very predictable and self-congratulatory. Ultimately, and in retrospect, a lot of it, especially the ending, is nonsensical, but that's true of so many movies, it's hard to knock this one in particular. But I can knock it for failing to deliver anything interesting, unique, or memorable.",NEGATIVE
856,"A film with too slow a tempo to experience real tension. The final twist is also not convincing. Unfortunately, the film ended up being a disappointment.",NEGATIVE
857,BEST MOVIE EVER…. IM DEFINITELY GOING TO SEE IT AGAIN IN THEATERS. (P.s. if you don’t like or play video games then you won’t understand the movie).,POSITIVE
858,"James Wan returns to direct a horror film since The Conjuring 2 (2016). With new ideas, Malignant proves that he is one of the masters of modern horror.",POSITIVE
859,"Absolutely wonderful movie, very enjoyable, lots of action, funny moments, etc my husband and I loved it, my 3 children (16, 15, and 11), and my mother we all loved it! Truly one of Disney's best",POSITIVE
860,awosome movie and fresh comsep great time spain good action and good grapic and more fun,POSITIVE
861,"The title is an abbreviation for “Child of Deaf Adults.” In this case, a teen (Emilia Jones) lives with her parents and brother, all of whom are deaf. She’s often been their go-between with the hearing world and faced scorn from her classmates, but her talent for singing presents issues on several levels. The ensemble is excellent. Of course, Marlee Matlin (the mom) is an Oscar-winning presence, but Troy Kotsur (the father) is certainly headed for acclaim for his raucous and sensitive portrayal (the scene where his daughter sings just for him is award worthy alone). The family relationships are beautifully portrayed and it helps that there are genuinely funny moments peppered throughout. Even though the plot points are predictable, the writing never resorts to gooey sentimentality. It’s truly a heart-warming experience and a well-crafted film. One snag: The boyfriend doesn’t possess the singing talent of Ruby.",POSITIVE
862,Its lame and it very unrealistic and dramatic has nothing to do with racing the first 3 will forever be the best ones,POSITIVE
863,"MetacriticOnur - You are not posting reviews. Apparently reporting you to metacritic does nothing, so please start actually covering the material. Just posting a dictionary description of the single word you are applying is both annoying and useless for people to evaluate the movie/show. Also try to make sure the text of the review matches the score. In this case your score of 4/10 is NOT average by any stretch of the imagination. Average would be in the 5.5-6.0 range, as that encompasses most movies. Jungle Cruise is just small amount of better material loosely stitched together in the hopes that another formulaic Disney PG13 release will help fill the void that their previous streaming lackluster releases have left behind. Unfortunately it does not. The music and talent do a decent job, but with a patchwork script that does not know what it wants to be, a 4/10 is the best it can muster.",NEGATIVE
864,This movie was one of the worst movies I ever seen be released in cinema. Hard to watch “acting” aside from Charlize Theron and Vin Diesel is just the same as always but still good and Han is always good but what? His character is back? The rest of the actors I think haven’t acted in years and lost any acting abilities. The story is so bad and messy I couldn’t believe a writer would write this screenplay and say to themselves “I am a writer” because the dialogue was brutal and they were just regurgitating old characters up from the past just to bring some nostalgia into it but it was just awkward and made you puke a little in your mouth. I just can’t believe some production house and their investors would spend 250 million on garbage like this. Wow!,NEGATIVE
865,"Absolutely pointless, lackluster plot, if any. Actors are ok, but basically, this movie consists only of stupid shooting scenes. Since the subject is a philosophical one, the producers could have made the movie a lot more interesting.",NEGATIVE
866,"So much fun to be had with this movie! Visually stunning, very glad I watched at an imax (sad to see it so empty on opening night though). Jodie and Ryan both provide a fantastic performance, and the pace is well maintained throughout. Certainly felt the first half was the better of the two, and didn’t care for the love story…. Luckily they didn’t dwell on it too much. Great fun watch!",POSITIVE
